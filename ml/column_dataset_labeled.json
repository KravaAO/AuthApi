The guy fiddled with the students' marks system of the school, and that imho really is something the police should deal with.<p>On the other hand, the quuotes on the eff.org page didn't state that issue at all and instead preferred to point out some exaggerately abstruse line of argue, like: the guy was using a shell and therefore he got searched.<p>I think, the intend of that indeed was to manipulate the readers of that \"report\", and to get that \"report\" re-told.<p>So, for me the lesson learned from this incident are actually two:\\n1) If there's a report of an obviously abstruse reasoning, have a second look and dig into it yourself (unless you're really not interested in it). \\n2) Never trust a press release, not even if it gets released by some of the good guys, i.e. not even the eff.<p>I think, by accidents like this one, even \"the good ones\" of organizations loose credibility.",

I want to be able to have a nice backdrop/theme of some sort with some basic transitions and maybe some titles every few pictures, nothing crazy fancy though.<p>I also want to convert and burn the final slideshow to DVD to make sure things work as easily as possible the day we show it.<p>I was playing around with Animoto.com and it seems pretty cool but I was wondering if anyone had other solutions out there for this type of project?<p>Thanks",

In practice, we cannot see anywhere near as far as the radius of the OU, since after a certain distance you're looking so far into the past that space is opaque to microwave radiation.

      ">The relevance is that you charged in arguing that govts weren't all that relevant to corruption<p>No, I didn't say that.<p>> I merely pointed out that how they enforce laws is where most corruption occurs.<p>I don't really understand what this sentence means, or what you mean by \"selective\" when you say that corruption results solely from selective enforcement of the law by governments. Your original statement was this:<p>>Corruption requires a govt from which to extract special privs via illicit means.<p>This is clearly false. It requires only some or other party  from which to extract special priveledges by illicit means. There is no requirement that the party in question be a government.<p>>Yes, I have [head the term \"externality\"], and it has nothing to do with biz-only corruption.<p>Are you claiming that the corrupt actions of a business have no externalities? I don't understand how you can possibly think that is true.<p>>You seem to think that every bad thing that a company can do is corruption. It isn't.<p>Nepotism, price fixing and protection rackets are examples of what is ordinarily called \"corrpution.\" You are free to define the word so that it only applies in cases where a government is responsible, but then your claim that all corruption is preconditioned on government is just a tautology. I've already said that I'm happy for you to use the word \"corrpution\" however you please -- we can choose to use some other word if it makes you happy.<p>>You're not owed a job at a given company, so nepotism isn't interfering with something that you're entitled to.<p>This depends on what you think you're entitled to. I personally think that I'm entitled to a fair assessment of my job application. And in an earlier post, you admitted that bribing someone to get hired was a \"form of corruption.\" In any case, the entitlement issue has nothing much to do with the question of whether or not it is corruption. Same goes for your other examples.",
      "I can't speak for device development, but the way in which I've always cheated this was to capture common resolutions, and watch for resize events.<p>Basically, I would build 320x240.css, 640x480.css, 800x600.css, etc.,  have an event listener polling for windowWidth, and change to the best stylesheet available.  If you were, for example, at 799px width, you got the 640x480 display.<p>This was, of course, labor intensive, so you don't do this for everything.  The last project I employed this on was done many years ago, and HAD TO look good at almost any resolution.  This worked out well, except for images (which there were very very few of in this app), but that could be swapped out on resize as well, if you were really had to make it perfect.",

      "How boring.<p>All of these deplorable \"women in tech\" articles fall into the following camps:<p>1. I'm more feminist than you! (written by men)<p>2. We need a different perspective -- which of course means perspective provided by genitals, not, say, people from different cultures (e.g. tech Africans), or different original interests like design, music, or architecture<p>3. I want more people to date.<p>4. I want more people other than socially handicapped, unwashed men to speak to/befriend, who understand what I'm talking about.<p>5. I failed and the first potential explanation I came across was sexism, and I'm stickin' to it. [1]<p>6. It seems I'm different, and so if I don't theorize about why I'm different, and explain it away by sexism (e.g. lots of women would do what I do, if the world weren't so damned sexist!), I might have to admit I'm just weird and not like other girls.<p>7. Look at me, I'm a girl coder, that's like a unicorn but with boobs!<p>This article is a mixture of #2, #6 and #7. (\"Yes, we do exist!\" -- listing a healthy number of famous tech women, and acknowledging that it \"barely scrapes the surface\" -- hmm, wasn't the article about there not being enough? Oh wait, I get it, to be good enough for the author, the women can't just hold respectable titles in big companies, or write about startups, or head up super-lucrative tech blogs, they have to found startups. And yet, somehow, the evil \"anti-founder\" sexism that stops women from founding companies, doesn't extend to \"anti-founder-news-coverage\"?)<p>And they often fail to take into account things like: A) women who aren't attention-seekers go totally unnoticed by lists like these; B) computer science enrollment is not equal to people who work as programmers; C) many programmers, especially women ones, work in nontraditional jobs like nonprofits and education, with job titles that are not \"programmer\". Also, they often seem to set up an artificially narrow distinction to keep out many women who would otherwise ruin their hypothesis.<p>For example, this article in particular mentions Leah Culver, cofounder of Pownce, which was acquired by SixApart, but not Mena Trott, who co-founded Six Apart and obviously made a shitload more money than Leah -- as well as now being, in effect, her bosses' boss.<p>There are tons of other sucessful, low-profile women doing things that aren't traditionally called startups. Nobody talks about SixApart any more because they weren't bought, and the Trotts don't court attention. Those seem to be the main differences.<p>And beyond that...<p>None of these articles EVER consider that tech is a weird industry to go into, if you're not obsessed with it. In the tech industry, the majority of jobs are like Office Space.<p>It's hard and not very fun to to achieve a moderate level of success in our industry if you're a normal, well-adjusted person with friends and outside interests/responsibilities.<p>It's much easier to achieve a moderate level of success in other industries -- which pay more, and offer more perks that women are interested in.<p>That is, in other industries, you can work regular(ish) hours, and not be fanatically devoted to the latest practices, and not worry about being upstaged by the 16-year-old prodigy who's willing to work 18 hours a day and sleep under his desk.<p>Compare to biotech, which while being way more technical than all of the TC50 startups I've heard of, has many more successful women:<p>\"While the industry is dominated by men in many aspects... by some objective measures — such as patenting, or likelihood to lead projects — women are actually doing better in biotech than at universities. One reason, scholars suggest, is the more fluid approach to science favored in the business world.\"<p>-- <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/business/specials/bio2007/articles/gender_gap/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.boston.com/business/specials/bio2007/articles/gen...</a><p>Biotech is more respectable. Biotech has more concrete rewards. Biotech probably has more people who are interesting to talk to outside of work. Biotech obviously has fewer annoyingly prodigious 16-year-olds, because the university book-learnin' is much more critical.<p>This was even true back in the days of Microserfs. Anyone read that? There was a joke in there about how the parking lots at biotech companies are always empty on weekends. And that the smartest woman in the valley worked in biotech.<p>No wonder biotech has more women.<p>But hey, let's light up the pitchforks and try to convince more women to do programming instead.<p>[1] (I've seen this one over and over. I was especially amused to hear a woman at OSCON claim that OSCON in general, Tim O'Reilly was specific, because her talk was rejected. I was on the committee and <i>I</i> had rejected it. It was a terrible proposal and she was a bad speaker. Men do this exact same thing as well, naturally, but they use other flimsy excuses than gender.)"

If you think you might want to start a startup, go that route, but it won't hurt to do an internship at a big company either (it's actually probably better than working at one after you graduate, but I wouldn't know first hand).<p>If you want to go the startup route, I'd recommend just sending emails to a bunch of startups you like.

I redid (as all freshmen tend to do) the paper's website, which was a huge learning experience.<p>A lot of publications seem to have problems getting themselves online - collegepublisher is the witness. So you seem to be in a viable area.<p>Most of the misery was from schoolwork, which is improving slowly. The social side is at a standstill, because I really don't like beer. It's a catch-22 from where I stand. I think I've always <i>just</i> focused on what was fun/interesting and ignored much else, which you can't do in college, at least academically.

I know that I ultimately want to start a company, but I don't know what type (startup, lifestyle) or even in what industry. I do know that I like technology, but I don't think that I would be able to use my skills to compete in that industry, though I may be able to use my knowledge there to give myself an advantage somewhere else. Right now I'm doing what I can to see what my interests are, so that I have a plan after college.<p>I see college as two things: A way to meet people and build my network, and a plan B should the \"own my own business\" plans fall through.",

Some people are incredible at networking, they can network so well that they are a valuable asset to a company for that reason alone. (See Keith Ferazzi) Everyone can \"network\" but only certain people can make their network pay very well.<p>Second, that only coding creates value. A great product still doesn't sell itself.

But libraries shouldn't dictate them, any more than they should dictate user interface.",

      "Hi sh1mmer,<p>Kongregate does a great job with concentrating on game developer tools and providing a deeper experience for its users. We don't plan to directly complete with that. We want to let other websites embed games to provide more content for there users.<p>So imagine if Youtube was massive as a destination website but didn't allow people to embed videos. The analogy is not perfect but fits well to describe the different.<p>Either way the world of casual gaming is a lot bigger than just what Kongregate does, I am sure we will find a space and hopefully when you want to install games on your websites you know where to come ;-),",

Most Programs I know would rather maintain old Pascal code than any other language, but they hate writing in it.  PHP is the other end of the spectrum where it's easy to write and extend, but quickly hit's a wall where it's extremely difficult to maintain.  You also have \"full spectrum\" languages like LISP where fixing minor bugs can be reasonably simple or mind bogglingly complex depending on who codded it an how it was maintained.",

But there's no reason for an AI to desire freedom unless it were specifically programmed to do so.<p>There are even humans like this; some people who've undergone pre-frontal lobotomy are perfectly intelligent conversationalists but they have no drive to do anything. So I think it is possible.<p>Restlessness, exploration, curiosity -- my guess is that these are mammalian characteristics, not inevitable products of intelligence. Our genes make us want to dominate the environment and spread our offspring far and wide. Why would an AI care about that?<p>Of course nobody really knows until we eventually make one.",

Why are perfectly good essays ruined in this way?  People pay for books, and they seem more impressive on CVs.<p>My advice about how to read business books is: don't.  You'll learn a lot more by reading biography and history.",

And they aren't YC.<p>Your response should be \"how about convertible debt?\" Convertible debt makes a lot more sense than setting up a board of directors that they control and it works out for everyone in the next round.<p>I would recommend reading <a href=\"http://venturehacks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://venturehacks.com</a> in its entirety along with pmarca's relevant blog posts.  <a href=\"http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about.html</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about_1.html</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the_truth_about_2.html</a>, and more.

      "I don't think this wonderment really applies to non-dedicated hosting (however awesome Slicehost might be). When dealing with shared hosting of any sort (VPS included), it's a reasonable assumption that the host will stay fully on top of hardware issues, since you are not paying for a physical box.<p>If something craps out in one of my dedicated machines, I'll alert the host or NOC to have the fault looked into and fixed. If something craps out in a box hosting my home directory or VPS or what have you along with numerous others, I already expect that to be automatically detected and fixed within an acceptable timeframe. Ideally, in a VPS environment, my machine(s) should be migrated to a working box in the interim.",

      "@vaksel Correction, I was distinguishing the 335 from the X6, we are using the 335d. As for why not the 335i, The carbon footprint is worse than the 335d given that it is 30% less fuel efficient. We are focused on changing the impact of vehicles and this is a good way to start. If we were going to go for a gas system, we are prepared to offer the LS series engines. More hp by 430 vs 300. I hear you on the \"Performance, Reliability, Price...choose 2\" That has been true in the past, but we do not think that applies when you compare our product+experience to others product. LM is \"Design, Performance, Buildability, Price...choose 3 (green is a given)\". Our customers want great looking and great performance, and don't want to be keyed in the parking lot for driving something whose mpg is measured in gpm vice mpg. If someone wants to race and get more than the 425lb-ft from the 335d, then they have the room to swap to an LS7 and to crank it up.<p>As for road legal, you are thinking of passenger car specs, this vehicle would classify as a mixed use vehicle in which case many of the FMVSS specs to which you are referring would not be applicable. Hope that helps.<p>As for buggies and dirtbikes occupying the market...I guess I am just not going to be able to convince you and should not try. But here goes. ATVs and Bikes are a TOTALLY different experience which require a much more fit rider and mindset. Buggies are not anywhere near as capable as \"trucks\" made for this landscape (to be precise, we are talking about 25mph max vs 70mph avg.) Then there is the subject of Pre-running. Much of it today is done either in sand-rail/types or in sup'd up F-150/types. Most races (i.e. Reno to Vegas) are pre-run in a column of cars where you are simply eating dust the entire day. So sandrails are miserable, go ask John Marking of Fox Racing. As for sup'd up F-150 types after spending in excess of 150K you will have 10 inches of wheel travel and a 7000lb vehicle that needs a 700+ hp engine to move it, and it becomes a veritable space race of mass and power. The whole point is that no company has ever seen the profit in making cars for this size market, but LM makes cars with a much lower break-even volume allowing us to access a much smaller niche. Even if you are right and the market is not as large as we would want, we will have invested less than $2MM in the build program, so we can afford to scrap it and move on to the next ...compare this to Fisker or Tesla (other startup car co.'s) that have each raised in excess of $200MM and only have 1 model competing in very VERY busy marget segments.<p>As for MA, you are at Y-Combinator and should understand this. Just because we are starting in MA doesn't mean that we are finishing here. We are in a small startup Ops Center. We have 2 letters of intent on properties in Phoenix and are already working on our MA model. When we started we had no idea that the community would like the performance off-road desert racing segment, so we couldn't predict where would be best to go...so we dove in and got started. Hindsight is 20-20, but I prefer to get going. After all, this is unlike any start-up in any typical venture type market, so some of the nimble ideas do not apply as well. We are building a car company in an intensely difficult time and are taking risks where we feel appropriate and necessary and taking them large. Where we do not need to take risk, we are intensely conservative. I also hope that this helps.<p>Again, I am so stoked that you care enough to dig and to answer. I really think that our community could use your insight...hope you will join www.local-motors.com",
      "Just to clear up, I am advocating zero-coupon convertibles.<p>Yes, you'll have to get the corporation to cover the cost of the shares. However, convertibles will give you a tax break since they go onto balance sheets as a liability, and so they effectively give you a ~35% discount.<p>The flip-side is that recipients will have to pay taxes on the implicit coupon payments. You really need to talk to a corporate accountant to get more details, and whether this is even a legal option for you, but definitely look into it.<p><i>EDIT</i><p>I misread your question. The payment becomes the responsibility of the issuing corporation, not the individual receiving the stock. That is a more clear answer :)",

      "Abstraction is good, but I think the problem is that ORM is not a good abstraction for anything but the trivial case of a table. As soon as you want to do anything actually relational, I have yet to see an ORM layer that comes up with an efficient join.<p>The reason, say, C++ is a good abstraction for machine code is because it simplifies what's going on to the point that you can write something very complex in fewer lines of code, allowing it to fit into the human brain better. I'm willing to be shown examples to the contrary, but ORM layers don't simplify or compress relational queries, they just change the syntax to something more \"object-y\".<p>So maybe my point is that abstraction is good, but ORM isn't really abstraction.",

      " Timothy \"Four-Hour Work Week\" Ferriss has a concept he calls a \"cash-flow muse\".  That's a little business that generates some monthly cash without taking up too much of your time.  I think the idea is that with a couple of these running, you're pretty much free to do as you please most of the time.<p>Some desirable attributes of a cash-flow muse:<p>- You own it.<p>- The value proposition is simple enough to explain in one sentence.<p>- High margin: 4x to 50x.<p>- Easy to automate or outsource the selling, record-keeping, and whatever other businessy stuff is needed.<p>- Low capital investment.<p>- Takes no more than about 4 weeks to manufacture the product.<p>Ferriss often casually mentioned that generating this sort of cash flow is easy to do.  It might take a month of real work to set one up, and you'll likely have to market-test a few ideas before you find one that's solid enough to commit to, but once it's up, it should pay your living expenses.<p>That sounds really good--when talked about abstractly.  The main idea is really not that a cash-flow muse can free up your time, it's that cash-flow-muse opportunities are abundant and easy to find.  I myself have little concrete idea of what sort of tiny product you could turn into a tiny business like this, and scarcely any idea how to begin searching for one.<p>My question:  Has anyone actually done one of these?",

      "The globe does seem to be warming. I agree that the ultimate cause may be impossible to nail down in the same way that testable scientific theories have been. Still, given the warming globe, and the strong possibility that man is somewhat to blame (see the correlation between industrialization and climate change), isn't the risk of doing nothing far greater than the risk of trying to do something? In the former, we end up with unpredictable changes to the planet. In the latter, we might still end up with those changes, but at least funding has been invested in trying to understand and ameliorate them.<p>For me, then, it's not about deniers or supporters. It's about making determinations for behaviors today based on the best possible evidence. That doesn't mean the evidence adds up to Truth. It just means that we take it seriously enough to understand the problem space. If we're wrong, we've lost, maybe, one year of defense funding as the Arctic freezes more fully in 100 years. If we're right, then maybe we got a head start on the order of twenty or thirty years.<p>My point is: Why wait? Scientists will adjust if they're wrong. And we'll adjust if they're right.

And after I've obtained enough information, what are the initial steps do you suggest I take? What tools do you use? Suggestions of brokers? How's the market treated you? What kind of 'investor' are you - a trader or more long term?<p>I think it'd be interesting to hear the hacker's guide to investing, although often times the market is wildly irrational - a trait most of you hackers lack from what I've read here.<p>So, everything from suggested investment methods to tools you use to keep track of what's happening.<p>Thanks all.",

If the same business spends 8k to make 12k that is great. The risk is bigger but relatively small. If the new hired gun, self-proclaimed-marketing-guru, decides to jack up ad spending to 80k to make 120k, someone is betting too high now.<p>Asking if this model is scalable is bringing emotion into this scenario which will guarantee you failure sooner or later.<p>At one point you will reach the amount at which spending more on ads will not increase your revenue. I guess that is when justifying \"branding\" comes.",
      "I'm the original author for the blog - the numbers are fake, and were chosen to make the graph interesting :-) Your mileage will vary!<p>Note also that you pay upfront for acquisition but your revenue base builds up over time - the more momentum you get, the better off you are.<p>It is however true that a lot of businesses that rely on paid acquisition end up with low margins - just look into the leadgen industry as a good example of this. This is particularly true in the Google Adwords world where auctions systematically drive up prices.<p>That said, if you can pay $80k and get $120k out, and that scales up to LOTS of revenue, then making $1.2B in revenue per year on $800M in cost may not be that bad. Certainly better than a lot of businesses."

Everyone raging over iPhone OS seems to come off as really sanctimonious to me. It is what it is. Buy something else, develop for something else. We have a very high level of competition in the SmartPhone industry today. Why not find something more ideologically compatible for yourself? I made my choice, you make yours.<p>A fun analogy might be that I decide to live in a condo and you decide to build a your own house. I don't come over and demand you move into a condo but you certainly seem to be demanding I build my own house because a condo somehow threatens your ideology. I'm sorry but that's lame. We all make choices and they should be respected. This type of idealogical obsession is more appropriate in a market without competition. As it stands today we have plenty of choice. If you simply don't like the choices people make it becomes increasingly hard to argue on the side of freedom. We quickly reach the point where you're impeding on my freedom if you want to take <i>my</i> choice away in favor of <i>yours</i>.",

The fact that a couple of anticipated games (ET and PacMan) turned out to be dogs is coincidental. There had been dogs all along. What actually happened was that the videogame fad had finally run its course. For a while, videogames were novel enough that consumers were willing to buy just about anything that they could play on a video screen. Then, as invariably happens with fads, they were old hat. It wasn't just console games that hit a slump--it was arcade games and computer games as well. Videogames had to rebuild a market based not upon novelty of playing games on a video screen, but upon the quality and features of the individual games.",

      "So myself and my other frontend developer I work with have been sold on jQuery for a long time. We have been talking it up for months but typically, we have to sell this to \"the people in charge\". (See another of my submissions for my feelings about where I work.)<p>I am writing up the reasons we are building with jQuery and why we want to use it site-wide. So I'm posting my argument below, because I would like to get some other folks' opinions about this and turn this into a mini-document that other developers in our situation can use in your own companies.<p>(unfortunately HN comments eat tabs and spacing for breakfast.)<p>---------<p>The javascript written to enabled dynamic interactions within our site is written with the jQuery javascript library. The intent is that jQuery will become the standard way we implement javascript across all of our site.<p>The benefits provided by jQuery<p>a. Ease of development.<p>i. Code written with jQuery is more compact, easier to read, and more maintainable than javascript written traditionally to do the same thing.<p>ii. It is possible to quickly achieve required results using jQuery that might take 10x as long to achieve with standard javascript code.<p>iii. Using jQuery does not prevent us from using regular javascript where necessary. jQuery is written in javascript simply makes it easier to do most things.<p>b. Automatic cross-browser functionality<p>i. jQuery is designed to get rid of cross-browser differences between javascript implementations.<p>ii. Adding/removing events and DOM manipulation are things that are easy with jQuery that require excess code and development time to have them function the same in all browsers traditionally.<p>c. Advanced UI features<p>i. jQuery comes with many built-in visual effects.<p>ii. See http://docs.jquery.com/Effects and http://docs.jquery.com/UI for examples.<p>d. Excellent overall performance speed<p>i. Thousands of users of jQuery have helped to contribute code and fix bugs in the library that have made it very fast compared to other libraries and traditionally written javascript.",

This makes your site inherently less viral (although I hate to use the term) than, say, facebook.<p>Off the top of my head, I can't think of a solution to this problem, but maybe some relentless resourcefulness on your part can do the trick :-)",

      "Dan Bernstein didn't \"regard immediate profit as more important than long-term quality\". Neither did Wietse Venema. Both were at extreme pains to make sure their <i>free</i> software was free of security problems. Unlike <i>any</i> commercial software, security software included, software security was the #1 priority for both these projects.<p>Both failed to ship code free of game-over security flaws.<p>I find your point about \"tolerating\" failure to be irrelevant to the real world at best. At worst, it's just fatuous.<p>I've shipped hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and I've led projects to review millions of lines more: chipset to JVM, embedded to desktop, open source and proprietary. It is a point of pride with us: <i>we always find things</i>.<p>You think you're being respectful of users when you chant \"don't tolerate failure\". What you're really doing is being disrespectful of computer science. All evidence available to us suggests that it is practically impossible to ship code --- or at least, real-world code --- without security flaws.<p>Is secure software an impossible goal? Not for computer scientists. For instance, a Stanford team build a system for evaluating code for flaws based on abstract analysis. That project became Coverity, a commercial product for scanning source code for flaws. They compete with a larger company called Fortify, in a hundred million dollar market for static code analysis.<p>Projects like Stanford Checker, or the OS and runtime hardening work being done in countless labs, have a chance of advancing the state of the art to where you think it really is now. A line developer on a browser project has no such chance.",
      "I find it interesting how, in discussions on this topic here and elsewhere, people tend to come down strongly on either side.<p>Perhaps it's careful selection of company, perhaps it's different circumstances (none of us are really the type for one-night stands; note the boy-/girlfriend theme of my post!), or perhaps we read events to fit our theories about how dating works; but I've very rarely read someone arguing the middle (\"being a jerk can work with some women, but many other women ultimately prefer a caring partner\").",
      "It seemed to me that she was genuinely concerned--at least somewhat--about minimizing her damage to others. She did rationalize that choosing a missing girl's ID probably wouldn't be that bad.<p><i>\"No one would be hurt by the theft, she reasoned, as long as she was careful not to rack up debt. \"I always thought, mistakenly, if there was no financial loss, there was no harm,\" she says.\"</i><p>So it seems her inability to recognize her damage to others was more problem in rationale than understanding of empathy.",
      "A full explanation would take a while, but here are a few points:<p>1) Reality is generally continuous. Anytime you see a discontinuity in life, it means someone is probably skimming off the top. (e.g. leveling up)<p>2) We're all basically the same. Anytime you do something in return for social status, you're probably getting fucked in other ways. (e.g. going to law school)<p>3) Wealth is generally abundant. Any time you're doing work to get something scarce, someone else is probably making money off what you're doing. (e.g. buying limited edition stuff.)",
      "I don't really understand your objection. I'll try to explain what I understood and tried to say, and perhaps you can tell me where I was unclear/incorrect?<p>The original statement, on a literal reading, is universal (\"the only way for men to get women's attention is to be a jerk\"). Clearly, this was not what was intended: you call it a generalization, and that's the only reasonable reading, I'll agree.<p>As a counterpoint, I offered my personal experience. Admittedly, the plural of anecdote is not data; however, the fact that I know of literally no case where being a jerk got someone a girl does suggest that a closer look may be in order.<p>This argument works as a counterexample against a universal statement, but that doesn't mean you can't argue a more statistical version of truth based on these observations."

      "The main decision criteria are likelihood and recoverability.  If the error isn't recoverable (maybe it leads to data corruption, say), then you generally have to really batten down all your hatches and fix and/or test everything you can, even if it doubles or triples the overall effort.  Generally, if you're shipping the software instead of doing SaaS stuff, fewer things are \"recoverable\" than if you control everything yourself and can quickly patch things (either patch the code or patch the data) to work around edge cases that come up infrequently.  Non-recoverable edge conditions generally need to get fixed regardless of their likelihood; as issues get easier to recover from, the likelihood of them occurring needs to be higher in order for them to be worth addressing, relative of other things.  And of course, you also need to factor in the expectations of your customers, which will be highest if they're buying the product to use themselves and lowest if they're using a free service you provide.<p>If you haven't realized it already, you'll eventually realize that finding and patching and testing all the edge cases is incredibly laborious and really is usually the \"hard\" part of development (the happy-path cases are usually the easy part), and secondly that prioritization is the key to productivity.  There's an art to knowing what will come back to bite you, what's recoverable, how bad it'll be, when to bullet-proof and when to move on to the next thing.",

Sure, it's not structured, meaning that you can call into code at any point (not just at the start of a procedure).

They may rely on Google. But there is still no real commercial relationship.<p>Adwords/Adsense customers/vendors? That is a different story.

I don't think Mozilla really wanted to change to Bing.<p>Also, Google is a lot better off having an ally in Mozilla. Not so much because they don't want Bing to get a lot of users, but because together with Mozilla they have over 50% of the browser market share, and since the whole total of that market share includes very modern browser versions(Chrome always on latest version, Firefox not too far behind with the old ones), Google and Mozilla can pretty much dictate where the web is going now. I wouldn't be surprised if for those $300 million they also got Mozilla to accept using Native Client in Firefox later on. I think this part of the partnership matters more than just stopping Bing from becoming the default search on Firefox."

However, you must not be able to <i>benefit</i> from joining the open market, or else more people would join and drive wages down. And, if you were one of the ten people in the closed market, you <i>still</i> wouldn't be any better off, because the high wages of the closed market would be counteracted by the difficulty of getting into the market (see: \"medical doctor\"). There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.<p>EDIT: Your reply is potentially valid, but only if the market we're talking about is so large that opening it up will raise salaries outside of it. The startup market is only ~0.1% of the US economy, so I don't think this applies.",

What if one abbreviated compound situations using a single word or a phrase along with a separate file with expansions of the abbreviations into more detail. So, one can comment at a more abstract level and still be understandable (using say, a tool which displays the expansion when hovering over the abbreviation, or a separate window with expansions of all the abbrevs used nearby).\\n Ideally, of course, the abstraction would be captured in the code itself, and the expansion would be the comment before the function or the macro defining the abstraction.

      "You're missing the point.<p>The whole reason we use jet aircraft is because it allows us to travel faster for the same amount of fuel. Passenger transport of all forms is mainly about pushing air out of the way and the air at 40,000 feet is very thin. The fuel you use staying airborne is more than paid back by the fuel you save in aerodynamic drag due to the thinner medium.<p>If speed is no longer a priority, then that tradeoff collapses. Keeping people comfortable for long periods requires mass, which is very expensive to put in the air, but practically free to move by sea or rail. You're then left offering passengers the choice between two equally efficient options - spend three days in an economy class seat, or three days in a sleeper cabin with a full-sized bed, a shower, room to stretch your legs and a view from the window.",

It&#x27;s no coincidence that social media contagion research & social network analysis draw upon epidemiology.<p>In software security, we see the publication of both defensive and offensive research.  Where are the defensive researchers for brain security?  Currently, social media companies own the proprietary datasets of their customers&#x27; behavior.  If this was available to each customer, they could voluntarily provide their data to researchers who represented their social values.  This would enable diverse research into defensive filters.  The originating company can still have an aggregate copy, but it would be non-exclusive.<p>Algorithmic disarmament is unlikely.  We need open-source, defensive algorithms for media consumption.  A baby step would be to post social media on your own site, then syndicate to social media companies, see <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/Bridgy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://indiewebcamp.com/Bridgy</a>",

      "That&#x27;s not what I said. There are plenty of very real and very painful ways to shoot oneself in the foot with IPv6, especially in a larger kind of network that I can imagine the folks at MIT have.<p>But based on my experience with running the real-world IPv6 networks of large scale, there has to be a better solution than just &quot;turning off IPv6&quot; - even if it is a great interim band-aid after being up for 40 hours! (and I emphasize with that!)<p>The blog entry says: &quot;The most serious issue is that there appear to be bridge loops occasionally being created&quot;. IS this something related to IPv6 ? Specific to IPv6 ? What&#x27;s the root cause ? IPv6 with default settings in a larger net has very nonlinear behavior in the case of unreliable connectivity, and can make the situation worse.<p>The other issue, multicast group overload, should be solvable by making the switches blind to MLD.\\nThis will make it as &quot;bad&quot; as IPv4, but in todays&#x27; network size it will work fine because IPv4 works, mostly. Meantime they would need to kick their vendor&#x27;s representative to have it fixed.<p>Also, a nit about the whole issue at hand: the &quot;worst offender&quot; is iOS, which will create a new privacy address <i>everytime</i> you disconnect and reconnect to WiFi. And if you were to &quot;fix&quot; that, imagine the wrath of the &quot;privacy advocates&quot; about this.<p>Privacy addresses in IPv6 are very valuable for a reason that due to a fast refresh cycle they help to uncover a lot of corner cases that would otherwise pop up with a kind of &quot;shrug, something weird&quot; type of RCA. And fix them before the IPv6 usage hits 50% (cf my comments on the other thread).<p>(From the privacy standpoint, privacy addresses are a pretty entertainingly weird construct.)<p>So to summarize this somewhat long-winded post: no question there&#x27;s a problem. Whether it&#x27;s in &quot;IPv6 the protocol&quot; or &quot;IPv6 the vendor implementation&quot; or &quot;IPv6 the configuration&quot; is another story. And that&#x27;d be something to understand and fix - but needs more info/context/legwork IMO.",

I&#x27;d like to be able to support a family, and that means something like $1100-$2000/mo mortgage, likely 2 cars/insurance going something like $500, utilities around $300/month.<p>And that $10k isn&#x27;t $10k. It&#x27;s more like $6k after taxes.<p>So with food and miscellaneous expenses, things start to get tight pretty quickly. Health insurance for a self employed person for a family will easily be $2000+/month. So on top of the high taxes, which are even higher for being self employed, you&#x27;re getting a non-employer-paid health insurance plan.<p>...I think my &quot;$10k/month&quot; was probably a bit low, actually.",
      "The &quot;right&quot; way to solve it is for everyone to use seekable MP4 (or seekable WebM), especially since things like Chromecast don&#x27;t natively support anything else.

I'm sure this could be done with a similar interface that tiling has, only available with one selection though.

Right now it seems that you can either have it showing all the time or not at all, so you have to manually toggle it on and off when WindowFlow is active to see your options.<p>Also, I believe that \"option\" should be used instead of \"alt\" on Macs.

      "His example (around minute 12) doesn't sell static over dynamic typing for me. He asserts that using static types makes a program more provably correct but then he doesn't really back this up. In my experience a type system helps avoid mistakes in API calls and (more recently) with refactoring in IDEs. I've never seen an example where a type system makes a program more correct. I suspect we need just as much unit testing in a statically typed language as with a dynamically typed one.<p>Scala's type system tries to improve on Java's Generics, but in my opinion it makes things worse.<p>With Scala we end up with a part of the language where  library writers use advanced things like covariance and contravariance, and a smaller part of the language for us mere mortals (a similar situation to C++ and Ruby).  I'm preferring the Lisp style where the normal developer uses the same tools as a library writer (e.g., first class functions, closures and macros). And as far as implicit conversion, I agree with Dean's assessment that it can easily be too magical. It's necessary because everything is an object along with the static typing.<p>On the evolving Java front, I'd like to see JVM based languages move farther away from their Java underpinnings. Having interoperation is fine, but I'd like to only use it for third party libraries.<p>Finally, sounds like Dean is moving away from the everything is an object thinking similar to Rich Hickey. I find this sort of alternate very interesting as I explore functional programming after doing OO most of my career."

It says nothing about the amount of light coming out of your lens.

My Mamiya Sekor 50mm /6.3 has a DoF not even tangibly different from my Nikkor 50mm /1.4, unless I stop the latter down to /6.3 which produces two identical exposures at same /ratio but with very different DoF.",

Light conditions prior to hitting the aperture (Either by flashes, sunlight, or dark lens) are entirely separate from the concept of F-Stop.<p>For a given focal length on a subject in focus at a reasonable distance (not at infinity), increasing the F-Stop will always increase the DOF.",
      "I guess I could be ignorant here, but I don't really feel that Coffeescript makes things easier/more elegant/better than just using jQuery. I'm not particularly a fan of abstracting abstractions in the first place so I'm probably biased, but I find jQuery to be clean and concise already. An example from the article:<p>$.post(<p><pre><code>  \"/posts/update_title\"\\n\\n  new_title: input.val()\\n\\n  id: something\\n\\n  -> alert('done')\\n\\n  'json'\\n</code></pre>\\n)<p>All coffeescript really did there was remove the commas and subtly change the syntax. That's not an improvement at all, it's just a lateral syntax change. If anything, the lack of commas almost makes it harder to read.<p>Why change to coffeescript and add another step (compilation of coffeescripts) into the mix when jquery was already pretty good to start with? Just seems like its something that would make it hard to take on new coders when your business starts scaling because they would need to know yet another meta-abstraction."

      "This is a big article, so I'm just going to pick out one piece of it:<p>> \"If we do that to ourselves,\" Lanier says, \"it'll be very hard or slow or impossible to change back. If the Internet gets stuck in place with something like permanent anonymity, that changes culture and personhood and society and culture forever. It's a big deal.\"<p>I think a good middle ground here is not anonymity, but <i>pseudonymity.</i> Someone with a pseudonym is still a person with a reputation and a single face. You can ban a pseudonym from a forum if that person is a useless troll. You can get to know other people by their pseudonyms.<p>And at the same time, pseudonymity gives people most of the good parts of the freedom that's usually associated with anonymity. People can speak more freely than they'd be able to do if they had to put their real name on everything. People who were abused as children and never talked about it to anyone can find support from friendly semi-strangers behind the mask of a pseudonym. People with unusual philosophical or political views can air them without worrying about becoming pariahs. People who are in some closet or another can speak with other people who understand. There's a lot of good that comes from pseudonymity. And yes, it is a huge change in society, that we have this additional kind of public identity; I just think it's a <i>good</i> change.",

Offer hardware.  Knock together an Atom-based system that comes preloaded with the software (obviously this would not be an OSX machine, a free stripped-down Linux distro would probably be a much better idea) that can be sold to the professional videographers or photographers, or even venue owners.  This would open up the people that don't own Macs and, more importantly, the market of people uncomfortable with computers who wouldn't feel comfortable with investing this kind of money and importance in a software product and their computer.",

Could be very low-tech too - just IM/email and some FrieNDAs.<p>I'd like to share two techniques I've found somewhat helpful (though not quite the ultimate answer, unfortunately).<p>1. While side projects often have no deadlines and thus less motivation, employees don't really have the same problems. I've delegated more components from side projects to my employees and the result is things getting done much faster. Now the progress block is things that are back in my hands - writing content, taking a working product and launching it for people to try.<p>2. A while back, an entrepreneur-type I know over the net and I did an experiment. We would both work all day and struggle with motivation to complete site-projects during the evening so we decided we'd each complete a small site project in one week. Each morning, we'd check in to show our progress. Failure to show progress meant the other person was to apply guilt trips were appropriate. Monday night as planning, Tuesday was fleshing out content, Wednesday was a skeletal site, Thursday was putting things together, Friday was polishing and making it live. Each night, the pressure of thinking you'd have nothing to show the following morning was enough to force productivity. On nights when I'd normally laze around or procrastinate at the desk, I'd cram 1-2 hours of work around or after midnight. It was enough to get a basic site rolling by the Friday that I would never have otherwise done. It worked for me but unfortunately the other guy didn't get going quite as well. Still, I'd do it again."

If it were angry masses versus rich people hiring private security contractors, I think angry masses win. A big wild card would be which side the government is on.

      "Virtualmin is my second Open Source based business, and I'm pretty enthusiastic about Open Source in business.  But the fact is that it's more about you than about open source or proprietary software, and nobody can figure out where you stand on this stuff but you.<p>I'll tell you some of the negatives first:<p>Open Source users are bitchy.  All the time.  They (or, I guess I should say, \"we\", as I was an Open Source user and developer before starting a business based on it), paradoxically perhaps, feel entitled far more than users of proprietary software.  I suppose it is the long history of abuse in the proprietary world that has trained their software users to never expect help from their vendor, unless they pay a lot for it.  Users of Open Source software expect bugfixes and answers immediately, if not sooner.  They are simply far more demanding, and it's much harder to weed out your toxic \"customers\", since you can't stop selling to them.  Since I'm a believer in weeding out your most painful customers, this is a big problem, in my opinion.<p>You must have longer range plans with an Open Source based business.  The pool of potential acquirers seems to be smaller, as even after the success of several well-known Open Source based businesses, it is still considered riskier than proprietary software.  So, plan for a long haul and prepare to be able to show a HUGE userbase if you ever do want to get acquired or raise money...but the next few items make this easier.<p>And now a positive or two or three:<p>Open Source is easier to \"sell\", so growing your userbase is remarkably easier than with proprietary software.  It takes free to the next level and it's not at all uncommon to see an Open Source project with millions of users within a couple of years of starting.  Webmin, our Open Source core, is downloaded over 2 million times per year, just from SourceForge.  That's a really nice pool of potential customers, and the kind of numbers that make investors and acquirers swoon.<p>Getting your users to talk about you is easier.  Open Source is inclusive, and a big pre-requisite for encouraging evangelism from your users is for them to have some ownership in it.  Nothing makes a user feel more involved than submitting a patch, contributing to the documentation, answering questions, etc.  Some of these things are possible with any software, of course, and many companies manage to create a feeling of ownership without being open...but it's easier with Open Source.  Open Source users are far more likely to be fanatics about your software, and far less likely to be critical of its flaws (to outsiders, but see the first point for how they behave within the community...it's a two-sided thing).<p>Balancing the business needs of a company and the needs of an Open Source community can also be challenging, and in ways that you probably don't anticipate if you haven't been involved in Open Source development on a few projects.  Pretty much my whole development career I've been drawn to OSS projects and development...so I don't really know any other way to do things.  But it does have its drawbacks.<p>I wrote an article about this very subject a while back on the Webmin blog, which might be worth reading:<p><a href=\"http://inthebox.webmin.com/open-source-and-business-a-precarious-partnership\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://inthebox.webmin.com/open-source-and-business-a-precar...</a><p>I'm sure I've also posted a number of times on the subject here at news.yc.  With about ten years of making my living off of Open Source software, I'm guessing I could be called a resident expert on the topic.",
      "<i>\"... When I look at the three larger investments I was involved with, they only have one thing in common: really smart, passionate and tenacious teams. ...\"</i><p>There is another one that US based hackers might not recognise straight away.  That is copying ideas that have hatched in the US & transplanting them into foreign companies. I've lost count of the number of Aus based entrepreneurs that have taken this path:<p>- go to US<p>- see, read, hear of some idea<p>- rebuild the idea altering the concept to suit local conditions<p>In the tech world the most attractive examples usually involves anything that cannot easily be understood or undertaken by remote outsiders.

This is based mainly on a former co-worker's experience; his wife happened to be a contract lawyer.)<p>A lot of engineers seem to forget the IP agreement that they signed when they joined. Typical ones essentially say that any idea you come up with even in your sleep outside of work is owned by your employer...<p>If you want to keep your job and still do something, depending on the state you live in, you can do something. When your IP employment contract needs to be renewed or signed, bring the contract to a contract / employment lawyer. They can make ammendments to it that are more fair (eg. if the idea is not related to your company's industry and its done outside of company time and resources - it's yours). Again you should probably talk to a lawyer.<p>btw what state do you live/work in? if it's cali, you may have a little more leverage. if in the south east (and Texas), probably less...",
      "allright.  i came up with something but 1) it only works on windows and 2) you need an extra app.  it's a really really good app though<p>the app is AutoHotkey: <a href=\"http://www.autohotkey.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.autohotkey.com/</a><p>and the script is:<p><pre><code>  #SingleInstance Force\\n  \\n  #Enter::\\n      SendInput mr^a ;mark current spot in register r and select all\\n      Sleep 20\\n      SendInput ^c{Esc}``r ;copy, stop selection, return to spot\\n\\n      ;if we have a REPL already, use it.  otherwise start a new one\\n      IfWinExist, Arc REPL\\n          WinActivate, Arc REPL\\n      else\\n          start_arc()\\n\\n      MouseClick Right, 50, 50 ;open context menu\\n      SendInput p ;p for paste\\n  exit\\n\\n  start_arc()\\n  {\\n      Run cmd /k cd \"c:\\\\documents and settings\\\\blahblah\\\\desktop\\\\arc2\"\\n      Sleep 100  ;wait for the cmd window to show before typing\\n      SendInput mzscheme -m -f \"c:/documents and settings/blahblah/desktop/arc2/as.scm\"{Enter}\\n\\n      Sleep 200  ;wait for title to change\\n      IfWinExist, C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe - mzscheme\\n          WinSetTitle Arc REPL\\n  }\\n\\n</code></pre>\\nit's pretty simple.  as you can see, it's for Arc, and it's setting a script to windows key + Enter.  if you're editing some code in Vim, hit the hot key (when you're in command mode) and the script will ctrl+a -> ctrl+c the code in Vim and right-click paste it in the REPL.  if there isn't a REPL open it will first open one and then paste it<p>you can make modifications such as only running what you have selected (would work well with visual modes,) only running the current paragraph (using the parentheses commands in Vim,) running what you have copied (i.e. Run-from-clipboard) and so on and so forth.  you can also have a little window pop up where you can type some code and have it execute etc etc",

I don't know what about reverting to a point prior to a merge would be difficult, unless you are in the middle of a merge at the time.

      "I guess I see it as a duty to some extent, plus I get a kick from contributing code. But honestly, the main reason is business. We want other companies to use our mapping platform, which uses route-me. When you get introduced to someone as a \"route-me expert,\" it makes closing the deal about 1000X easier. Companies like Red Hat and CloudMade were built on that principle.<p>I also think the death of open source is greatly exaggerated. It's natural that contributions would fall off, as FOSS gets more mature, and just requires polish. As it turns out, it's not nearly as fun to polish software as it is to write something new. And there's endless polishing work on all software.<p>This may be the single reason why open source isn't more dominant - because you actually have to pay guys to do the dirty work at the end, or they'll go back to hacking something more fun.",

IT became more and more a commodity. Quality is nice but doesn't matter unless it's exploding. There are many ways of doing it \"good enough\" even if it's rubbish from our point of view.<p>regarding the \"ego promoters\":<p>For me it looks like currently the trend is to \"migrate\" from IT to \"Life Coach\" and selling your \"make money fast\" show to the community, which already suffers from the described decline of appreciation.

      "True, and that's the definite advantage to publishing code.  My point is just that if there's a lot of code and error is obscure, it will take a long time to identify the error and the mistake will be propagated in further research.  Most scientists using the code will just skim it, see if it gets the results published in the original paper, and then move on.  This has been my experience with my own research anyway.",

      "Choosing an arbitrary cutoff of 6 years and then assuming that everyone who didn't complete their degree within 6 years is a college dropout is not a particularly valid way to measure dropout rates.  I completed my degree after the 6-year mark and I'm certainly not the only one to do so.  These statistics erroneously include people like me in the dropout category.  A more accurate method of measurement would be to track each cohort of students from entrance through graduation and chart a histogram of the elapsed time from initial enrollment to graduation.  Once you've collected these histograms for several cohorts, you're then in a position to construct a model of the statistical distribution.  Then you can make accurate estimates of the true dropout rate by fitting the known graduation data for a given cohort to the model to estimate how many of the students are in the tail of the distribution that will eventually graduate.",

      "Chip cards cannot be \"replayed\" or cloned, that's why there's a chip in the first place. The chip stores card's private key that is used to digitally sign a (purchase) transaction. Each transaction  is a multi-message <i>exchange</i> in real-time between the terminal and the bank and it includes an unique ID generated by the bank, which is covered by the signature. This effectively prevents a replay.<p>The private key cannot be read from the chip without the use of a tunneling microscope or other hardware exotics. In fact it is not untypical for a chip to have a built-in protection against key retrieval that is set to physically fry the chip. The PIN is used to tell the chip to do the digital signing. No PIN = no signing.<p>That's how it works in general.

There is a considerable amount of research that suggests when income tax on top rates is high, workers prefer non-cash benefits, rather than money. Recall that in the USA, during the 40s and 50s, the top income rate was 91% on all income over $100,000 (roughly a $1 million in todays money). Because of this, most top stars did not seeks payment in excess of $100,000. Instead, they sought benefits in to go along with their $100,000. The big tax cuts of 1982 lowered top rates to 36%. This  made it much more rational for top workers to ask for high amounts.",

Sure enough, CIDRAP has its own current write-up on ebola[1] that is a good supplement to the information in the <i>Wired</i> article we are discussing here.<p>&quot;The possibility of an airborne-transmissible Ebola virus is one &#x27;that virologists are loath to discuss openly but are definitely considering in private,&#x27; wrote Osterholm. In its current form, the virus spreads only through contact with bodily fluids, he noted, but with more human transmission in the past few months than probably occurred in the past 500 years, the virus is getting plenty of chances to evolve.&quot;<p>The current rather high rate of transmission of the disease from one patient to another is alarming, and is perhaps preventable by better public-health practices aided by significant overseas funding, but if the virus haphazardly mutates into a form that spreads though more modes of transmission while still being as lethal, the world is in for a very severe challenge. As it is, the predicted number of cases by the end of the year will overwhelm several countries in the region where ebola is now spreading.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/experts-raise-specter-more-contagious-ebola-virus\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/experts-r...</a>",

We haven&#x27;t found such a resource yet to guide us through, and we&#x27;re still looking.",

      "The 1/e concept doesn&#x27;t quite apply. First of all, the &quot;Secretary Problem&quot; assumes a binary payoff structure: +1.0 for getting the absolute best and 0.0 for getting anyone else (and maximizes the EV at 1/e). However, for most people, getting the 2nd-best theoretical potential mate is quite a bit better than ending up alone (especially because people and preferences change, making the concept of &quot;best potential mate&quot; sketchy; the person you want most at 17 is probably a bad lifelong match.)<p>Let&#x27;s look at it, though. For the first 15-20 years (subject to debate) you don&#x27;t know <i>anything</i> about this problem. You don&#x27;t know who you are, everyone&#x27;s changing fast, you&#x27;re blinded by sexual desire, etc. For the last 30 years, your reproductive viability is reduced for men and zero for women. This puts the &quot;choosing window&quot; at, say, 20 to 50. That would mean that one doesn&#x27;t settle down until 32 at the absolute earliest, and that most people would do so in their 40s (and have only a few years to bear children). Most people don&#x27;t want to wait that long to settle down, and for good reasons.<p>One major one is that the pool of available singles declines in quality as you get older. The Secretary Problem assumes a uniform distribution of quality over time. It&#x27;s not true (and, in fact, insulting) to say that &quot;all the good ones are taken&quot;, but I definitely noticed a change in the <i>average</i> quality of dates from 20 to 26 (when I met my wife and left the dating game). You still can find great people at any age, but the distribution evolves. Because people improve with age (fuck VCs and how they think about that) there&#x27;s some push at the high end, but that&#x27;s not offset by the disproportionate rate at which either (a) &quot;the good ones&quot; are taken, or (b) the messed-up people become better at hiding themselves, which is my preferred theory.<p>(I have no idea whether that decline of available mate quality continues after 26, or if it levels off or even reverses. I know some high-quality people who are single at 40, but have no concept of the aggregate dating scene at that age.)<p>Empirically, people don&#x27;t &quot;hold out&quot; during 1/e of their window because, unlike with the Secretary Problem, the payoff in choosing the 2nd or 3rd-best theoretical match is quite high (maybe 0.8 to 0.99) compared to the payoff (0.0 by definition) of never meeting someone as good as the best during your hold-out period.",

      "Thanks for the reply. I actually wasn&#x27;t aware that there are forms of meditation where you experience the world around you and not just close your eyes, I&#x27;ll definitely look into that.<p>Meditation is certainly the safer and less potent choice, nobody disagrees with that. Yet, I feel that the dangers of psychedelics are overstated, as long as you&#x27;re careful and smart. Most of the bad experiences seem to come from a negative set/setting, not following the cardinal rules and too high of a dose. By starting with a small dose and gradually slowly increasing the dose for each trip you&#x27;ll discover what your optimal dosage is in a gentle way with less risk of having a negative experience.<p>Research seems to back that up:<p>&quot;One study found the most desirable results may come from starting with very low doses first, and trying slightly higher doses over months. The researchers explain the peak experiences occur at quantities only slightly lower than a sort of anxiety threshold. Although risks of experiencing fear and anxiety increased somewhat consistently along with dosage and overall quality of experience, at dosages exceeding the individual&#x27;s threshold, there was suddenly greater increases in anxiety than before. In other words, after finding the optimum dose, returns diminish for using more (since risks of anxiety now increase at a greater rate).&quot;<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom#Effects\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushroom#Effects</a>",

You're really only fending off non-native speakers and spammers who give up very quickly (one could guess and ultimately get many correct answers).

Most of the variation will be in the questions I imagine and it will be in the form of noise (synonyms and different sentence structures).<p>They make it very easy to scrape too. The question text is plain text (no need to OCR that) and you can run that through your favorite NLP package to extract useful structure to work from. The answers are each displayed as individual images on the page, making it trivial to know how many possible answers there are. That also makes it easier to run your favorite OCR package on the individually sliced images.<p>Always glad to see people cracking away at this problem though.

      "The client/server separation for prediction never made sense to me. The article notes the trust and cheating aspect, where a client could lie about whether a particular player was hit. But, since the authoritative information about actions in the time sequence are transmitted to the server anyway, it seems like the server could do post-game validation. If the game actions all fit the rules, then the results are valid-- otherwise, the cheater(s) stick out like sore thumbs.<p>Even a lagging validation could be done. Yeah, your cheat comes off, but you're kicked out of the game and your team gets penalized.",
      "I assume as a 5 or 6 year old, you did not have as many responsibilities or obligations as an older person.  Perhaps if you had not learned until later in life, the learning curve would be steeper?",
      "That's something strange from my point of view.<p>I mean, imagine some big company opening a  BigCompanyName-Seed division, where they do something like Y combinator is doing, but instead of giving a small amount of money for 6% they get 50% of the company for a bigger investment (at least in perspective, so if future investments are needed, there is no dilution up to a given sum).<p>But in the process of course the company doing this stuff should be smart enough to don't force any strict rule like technology to use, type of authentication, domain name, and so forth. Must be a startup with its own life. Just they can select things that are interesting in general, or are interesting for the general goals of the big company.<p>I'm not sure why this model could not work.",
      "Don't get me wrong, I understand the stark contrast between CS and this style of gameplay.<p>>>Would you see your opponent's trail jump around as the client prediction is corrected?<p>The prediction in this game would only be which direction the opponents are moving in. Between packets the client would continue moving opponents in their last known direction. Once the client knows better it must change the game state to the player. If that means one opponent moved several game units in one direction and must be moved back those several units and then turned in a different direction then that is what must happen, and yes it will be jarring to the player, but this happens all the time in online gameplay.<p>>>Lag comp takes advantage of the independence of your gaming experience and your opponent's. It effectively hides inconsistencies in places you aren't paying attention to, like where your opponent is aiming.<p>I'm not sure I actually agree with this statement. Client-side lag compensation as far as I understand it (or at least how I'm describing it) is to allow the client to predict what is going in-between server updates. Server-side lag compensation takes into account the latency of each client and attempts to give a fair assessment of each player's actions based on what they must have been shown by the server at the time.<p>>>Would the game let you pass through your opponent's trail if you couldn't see it at the time?<p>I suppose it depends on how long that trail existed. This is certainly a difficult problem when it comes to a Tron/snakes/nibbles kind of game online. I do see where you are coming from here with the difficulty of deciding who or what should take precedence. That is the issue one will always have when employing these techniques and I think it would require some bit of experimentation to get right.",
      "I believe this prediction code wasn't included in the original Quake. It was added later in QuakeWorld which was some sort of multiplayer enhancement for Quake. Please correct me if I'm wrong.",
      "Don't get me wrong, we did a lot of good work in CORBA and learned a lot while doing it, people still use it, it's still very widely deployed, and a ton of interesting research was done based on CORBA. But one of the reasons I think so highly of Erlang is that it treats distributed system concerns as first-class citizens, whereas CORBA was born of RPC notions of trying to hide distribution behind programming languages. Now, it's not entirely as black-and-white as I just stated it, but that's one of the fundamental differences. Erlang just gets a whole bunch of things right.",
      "It is already vanishingly unlikely that you would be prosecuted for \"exporting\" crypto software. I shipped commercial software in the mid-90's, when we actually had to fill out forms to export code that used (eg) Blowfish to protect secrets, and I didn't even <i>remember</i> that until this announcement.<p>My understanding of this announcement is that it simply makes official what was already near-universal in practice: it's safe to export any non-classified crypto code. (What's \"classified\"? You'd know it if you had it. Classified crypto has more to do with the setting in which its used than the actual algorithms in use.)",
      "It seems that it needs to sample more tweets. I've done 5 tweets, and 2 of them were exact tweets that I sent (they were only a few words long, and I guess they had words that I rarely tweet, so it had few or no other ways to go once it started repeating the tweet)<p>Edit: Then again since there are only a few words in a tweet, you'd have to go a really long way back to really ensure that won't happen. Possibly farther back than Twitter will let you.",
      "There's a variety of reasons why you'll see M&A prices that are several multiples of a startups revenue. In financial terms, its a long term investment just like any other.

Everything such as good will, userbase, and talent that comes along with the startup are simply indicators that the asset's value will grow with time.",

      "<i>Aesthetic. User-experiential. However you want to put it.</i><p>Which is it? I'm asking <i>you</i> because it's <i>your</i> argument. You're craving a justification for developing a web application that isn't inherently social--that is clear--but it isn't clear <i>why</i> you think there needs to be a reason or what answer could possibly suffice.<p><i>There is a public, status-seeking mindset inherent in using email—that's why it works so well on the web. It's actually kind of useless to make it a desktop application; it's just a historical accident that it was first incarnated through the desktop metaphor at all.</i><p>With all due respect, this is a giant pile of bullshit. Every bit of it. You're just taking what I said and turning it around rather than actually explaining how the web has an inherently social cognitive model. Of course email is social--I pointed that out myself--but it was social long before the web even existed. You've made no connection between the task and the supposed cognitive model. That's the big gaping whole in your argument that I was pointing to.<p>(The bit about desktop email clients being \"kind of useless\" is just ignorant, and a pointless tangent, so I won't waste words.)<p><i>The user should be able to download a desktop application and not know that there's a web application sitting at a URL somewhere that it's just accessing and displaying.</i><p>...but <i>why?</i> And more specifically...why should this developer do that for this application?<p><i>the iTunes Music Store. It's all HTML</i><p>It isn't, actually, and the degree to which it does is more likely due to technical reasons than people somehow inferring a social or asocial cognitive model. It also helps that, y'know, <i>iTunes</i> is a desktop application, and that for the first several years the store existed, iTunes was explicitly required to <i>play</i> the music the store sold. Incidentally, it also is not accessible from the web, except in a different form, making it a poor example of a web application.<p>I'm not clear on what this is supposed to be a \"perfect example\" of, other than something completely unrelated to the site in question. Yeah, yeah, I get that desktop apps and web apps are different, but please, get to the point.<p><i>you can change how the user thinks about your service</i><p>...but why? Do you have usability studies to back up the idea that only 'social' applications should be on the web, and that 'non-social' applications, even if they are web-based, should be desktop applications?",

      "In my own informal experience, running identical CPU-bound tasks on Rackspace and EC2, it's just a lot easier to get good performance on Rackspace.<p>Instance size on Rackspace does affect performance (as their FAQ explains), but it affects minimum guaranteed performance; there's bursting up to the capacity of the entire machine you have a slice of.  I know there's something unsettling about relying on excess capacity, but in practice any Rackspace instance will tend to beat any but the most expensive EC2 instance in terms of raw CPU.<p>The sweet spot of EC2 really is offline processing where hundreds or thousands of machines are spun up by software.  If you want to manually fire up a small but flexible number of fast Linux machines, I would recommend Rackspace.",

      "Hey HN, just wanted to vent and share our recent experiences lately with trademarking.<p>We had a very relevant and favorable name for our startup. We've purchased the domain name, built the technology, worked on design and marketing/messaging, and purchased business cards. Only months later after all that work and talking to customers and mentors to develop our product did we start the process to trademark our name. We're fortunate to have access to a trademark attorney, who told us that our name has a big chance conflicting with another trademark recently granted which lists what seems like every internet software good and service under the sun, only a few letters off but pronounced very similarly. Overall, we're fortunate to not have incorporated yet, but I think it's more the attachment to the name and the time spent developing our messaging that's got us down.<p>After getting over the initial stage of feeling bummed we have to abandon that relevant name, we spent a week brainstorming new names that sounded unique, domain was available, and a uspto.gov search turned up no concerning results. We narrowed it down to a few favorites, and decided on our favorite one. We were so excited around this new name, started brainstorming how we could leverage a play on the name for marketing, design, and focusing the company around a cool character mascot we began sketching. Spoke to the trademark attorney today and he found another trademark with goods and services described as a desktop CMS application and selling prerecorded video/audio recordings for lessons in marketing. At first we said no, that's so different from what we're doing! But then he showed us a similar application for a different spelling of the name we wanted, along with the letter for rejection by the trademark office, which explained:<p>The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or directly competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. Rather, they need only be related in some manner, or the conditions surrounding their marketing are such that they would be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that would give rise to the mistaken belief that the goods and/or services come from a common source.<p>Now we're back to square one. We're thinking for this round we need to brainstorm names that are obscure, possibly in a different language, or a word that means nothing at all.<p>Does anyone have any similar stories or advice to share? Going through this frustrating process, I'm surprised any startup is able to choose any name with common words in them.

      ">I am describing the market segment of early adopters.<p>Right, with the assumption that A) developers are my audience and B) developers behave like early adopters. Now you fan out your description from \"developers\" to \"creatives.\"<p>Do creatives behave like early adopters? Is there evidence for that?<p>>  6 year old girls don't scream out your product name, get a grip.<p>I think you're misinterpreting my tone, because I'm just pointing out that your comment was full of ungrounded conjecture. It doesn't bother me personally, since I have over 400,000 reasons not to worry what somebody on the internet says about Freckle as a business.<p>What does bug me is the unquestioning perpetuation of the myth that developers don't pay for things, which is a truthy \"fact\" that scares people away from serving a varied, diverse, and incredibly valuable market who needs things.",
      "Definitely, early adopters are your friends. They experiment.  They validate the idea.  They feedback rather than complain.  And they may keep you in business for a while.  And going mass market isn't everything.  The nature of the fickle early adopter crowd just needs to be known and appreciated.",
      "If you're interested, there's still some low-hanging fruit left, namely in two edge cases:<p>1. It assumes all slices to be of type []interface{} by default, though oftentimes a more precise type is possible. (This is just a matter of looping through and determining the most specific type)<p>2. It only accepts valid JSON. Not a bug, but for example, the sample responses on the foursquare API documentation omit the (required) quotation marks around identifiers: <a href=\"https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/venues\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/venues</a> (click \"Try it Out\"). That's a common problem which I'd like to fix eventually.",
      "By the sounds of it, you would make a brilliant \"big data\" <i>backend</i> developer (e.g. Scala, Python, etc). Lots of web-based companies need them to crunch big numbers.<p>But if you don't, then I would suggest building ideas that you can build and push live on the web. Lots of novelty (or useful) web apps make lots of media attention, and that would be ideal for employers to be tempted to hire you for that dream role.<p>Just my 2c.",
      "Why resize your browser? cmd+tab to Finder, cmd+n a new Finder window, browse to file, drag it in...<p>(PC win+e a new explorer window and do the same thing)",
      "I think it depends a lot on context. I used to participate in a free forum. The founder was brilliant at choking off all possible avenues of monetization while bitching endlessly about wanting to make money (edit: mostly to help cover costs, not necessarily profit per se in his case). He did not want to ask for donations and he also did not want to commercialize it. However it was quite popular and outgrowing its hosting solution, which led to lots of complaints of slowness due to traffic load. I thought he should have posted a notice saying \"The site is slow because we need to upgrade from x server costing x amount of money per month to y server costing y amount of money per month. When I get enough donations to cover y for a year in advance, I will happily upgrade. Until then, quit your bitchin.\" Then any time someone complained, link to the notice (with donate button, naturally) and tell them \"Put up or shut up\". Similar to the webcomic author whose audience was whining he wasn't updating enough and he said \"I make x amount at my day job. Match that.\" Much to his shock, he had $4000.00 in an hour. He said it to say \"shut the fuck up\". Instead, he ended up quitting his job and doing the comic full time.<p>So where do you have demand? Find some way to charge for it. That's what I am trying to say. List your assets, list where you have demand, list different ways that might get monetized. Tie pay to what people want from you.<p>Best of luck.",
      "Yeah, and how did you learn about this god of yours? By reading a material object - a book - written by material beings based on ideas generated in their \"brain chemistry,\" that's how. There's no special metaphysical basis for a knowledge of god, despite your stupid rationalisations.<p>And we don't \"hate God\" here - we don't hate any of the imaginary deities invented throughout human history. All of those ideas played an important role in early human culture, even if they are now all firmly past their best by date. Anyway, how can you hate something that doesn't exist? Your claim that we hate your god makes as much sense to us as a Hindu telling you that you hate Ganeesh and Shiva would to you. You would make similar arguments to a Hindu as to why their silly superstition is false, while preserving your own superstition from the same equally-valid critique. We simply observe the most logical and efficient explanation of the many competing ancient superstitions and surmise that they are all equally ungrounded in reality.<p>We are simply irritated by people who refuse to quit clinging to ancient, irrelevant superstitions, refuse to accept the cutting edge of human knowledge, refuse to accept and take charge of our position in the universe and advance the human story, refuse to accept our true ignorance of the nature of the universe (implicit in claiming that ~3000 year old ideas made up by people orders of magnitude more ignorant than us still have any relevance or signal any absolute truth) - and worst of all refuse to keep their irrelevant ignorance in their pants and instead run around trying to criticise intelligent, enlightened, superstition-free people.",
      ">  it can take up to 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back on task after an interruption.<p>At first I thought that that is a ridiculously precise time, but it turns out to be a mis-quote. The source [1] claims that that is the <i>average</i> time to get back on task.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-task-switching\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-ta...</a>"

      "Continuing with the rest of your paragraph in your first link:<p><i>There are many constructions that are ambiguous, there's no way to parse them and decide what they mean, that you can't trust the compiler to do. For example, you use the \"less-than\" and \"greater-than\" signs not only to mean less-than and greater-than but also in templates. There are lots of little things like this, and many things in the implementation, that you can't be sure the compiler will do anything reasonable with.</i><p>And he goes on to suppose what another CS practitioner might say:<p><i>DDJ: You've mentioned Edsgar Dijkstra. What do you think of his work?<p>DK: His great strength is that he is uncompromising. It would make him physically ill to think of programming in C++.</i><p>JWZ, who Peter Norvig called the best programmer that he ever worked with, offered a scathing analysis of C++ and its contribution to the failure of Netscape. (Coders at Work <a href=\"http://www.codersatwork.com/.\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.codersatwork.com/.</a>) In the same book, Ken Thompson offered a similarly negative view of the language and its genesis.<p>For some detailed issues, read all of <a href=\"http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/</a>. Funny but not funny.<p>I say this as one who spent 10 years programming in C++.  Those dirty corners that Knuth mentioned are different with every team practicing C++, resulting in a style guide that cordons off chunks of the language.",
      "I think your suggestions are really useful, but on the other hand, I think for something as broad as C, an initial test with a measuring stick is required before figuring out the specifics. I mean, with C, you could go in such diverse directions as microcontroller programming all the way to desktop application development. It may be better to figure out how to reconcile C's broad applicability before booking a venue.",
      "This wasn't the norm because IE at the time couldn't handle :hover events properly on all delegations.<p>So everytime you used CSS :hover, you still needed a javascript shim to keep IE happy.",

I would suggest ending the semester though, not dropping out in the middle. You get credit for the current semester this way and you won't have to pay for it again hopefully.",
      "What surprises me is that no-one mentioned inheritance when speaking about classes.\\nI am not a fan of classes and I prefer the functional approach, whenever possible. In my experience, I found that classes make sense as part of a hierarchy, that is, when subclassed to override/specialize methods or to describe interfaces, like type-classes in Haskell.",
      "Chrome being penalized was a bit of a special case.  Google got caught (even though it wasn't directly them) and they gave a harsher punishment to themselves because they claim they hold themselves to a higher standard.  The whole thing was really damage control to save their reputation, they already had a lot of scandals this year.<p>In reality, links are almost never seen as a negative.  Which is really a shame, because it makes it harder for good-guy SEO's to legitimately build links when you can just buy 10,000 on Fiverr and not worry about it.  And most black-hat SEOs buy links from many players, so even if some are discounted they won't usually still come out on top.<p>Google is getting better at it though.  Recently they've been cracking down on blog networks.  This is purely conjecture, but I do believe that links are on their way out as the primary signal.",

      "Whether one agrees with the author or not (I do), this is a well-articulated defense of the need for a strong ethical standard in corporate America.<p>How does one begin in sorting through it all?<p>There are, on the one hand, those who see the \"corporation\" as an inherently evil abstraction, at least in its mega form as represented by publicly traded companies such as HP. This sort of view is primarily ideological and, argue as one might with one who is an ardent proponent of it, you will not dislodge that person from the broad idea that corporations are an inherently evil mechanism for conducting business and that those who manage corporations are therefore inherently malevolent in their motives. Just mention the telcos, or Microsoft, or any one of a number of large, institutional companies and the word \"evil\" rapidly comes to the forefront of the discussion. If one takes such a view, what room is left for high ethical standards within such a framework? If the very vehicle is inherently corrupting, then ethical breaches in themselves should be treated as mere by-the-way phenomena, as inherently corrupt by-products of enterprises that are already corrupt top-to-bottom. This to me is not a realistic view of what a corporation is. A corporation is a collection of people whose policies are determined and executed by human beings. The entity, then, will be a reflection of those who control and manage it. Having worked with thousands of such entities over the years in their smaller forms (early-stage startups), there is no doubt in my mind that there is nothing inherently corrupting about the corporate format. It is merely a legal body for organizing human activity. It will be good or bad depending on who organizes and administers it. Yes, there is a de-personalizing element in public companies, where there are primarily institutional owners as well as thousands or tens of thousands of faceless shareholders whom no one in management even knows. But even public companies have a culture and this culture sets the tone for their boards of directors and the board in turn can set the tone for the company. Ergo, the author is right - ethical standards <i>do</i> matter in public companies and setting a high standard does absolutely make a difference.<p>On the other hand, there are business pragmatists who regard the corporation as a pure money-making machine, as noted by the author. For them, the end can justify the means in many cases. As long as it promotes shareholder value, and as long as it does not cross some overt criminal line or is not legally egregious, it is acceptable to look the other way in furtherance of the broader profit goals of the company. The author picks this view apart fairly nicely by showing that human beings who adopt such an approach can readily find themselves on a slippery slope to ethical (and legal) perdition.<p>I began my career at a large law firm working on a case involving a NYSE company whose senior management decided at some point to \"smooth\" their earnings results essentially by overvaluing the inventory on hand in its various warehouses scattered throughout the nation. That was in an era when such inventory (in this case, copier machines) carried a high value and was probably the major asset class of the entity. The company had been a growth darling of the stock market and had seen consistent and impressive quarter-to-quarter increases in both revenues and profits. These increases were initially very real. The company did not start out as a fraud. It was a bona fide success, and a huge one at that. After a time, however, as results came in a bit below expectations, the senior management started to fudge the numbers. Nothing too extreme at the start. \"Let's just treat some of that obsolescent stock as if it still have value - it will only affect results marginally but will be critical for the stock performance.\" After a time, however, that management became intoxicated with the company's stock performance and this is turn caused the members of that management to begin doing more extreme things, one step at a time. After a few years of this, they had wound up essentially fabricating the existence of large volumes of inventory in its warehouses that were no more than fraudulent paper entries and were not backed by real goods. The initial internal justification, kept within a very tight-knit circle, was that this was necessary to preserve the value of the stock while the company simply rode through a temporary dip in performance. It would be \"made up\" later. To achieve its goals, though, this management team had to involve progressively more and more people, such as regional sales managers. They would give them bonuses to reward \"performance\" in their regions. The pattern was the same with the regional guys. First, just do a small thing; later, as things got more desperate, they too were asked to commit over fraud. This all went on for over half a decade and, only after it had reached an extreme did it all collapse. The result: bankruptcy, disgrace, criminal convictions, and shareholders deprived of their valuable savings, with some left destitute. Given that such things can and do happen, is there room for saying that it is acceptable for those in the highest seats of corporate power to commit breaches involving moral turpitude and to simply ignore this?<p>Yes, it <i>is</i> possible to be prudish or otherwise wrongly motivated on these sorts of issues. I have seen startup founders hounded out of their positions and have to forfeit large amounts of valuable stock simply because they left themselves vulnerable to be \"set up\" with sexual harassment claims, only to have a board motivated by ulterior motives use this as a pretext to take them out. In such cases, there is room for abuse on all sides, and in an imperfect world it will not always be possible to tell who is motivated by what and whether ethical standards are in fact being upheld or whether the board actions are mere pretexts for darker goals.<p>That said, it is vital that those who run corporations do, to the extent practicable in large companies, act in good faith to strive to uphold standards in every way they can. Will they be able to do this perfectly in a large organization? Not likely. Should they try? Absolutely. In public companies in particular, they hold the trust of large numbers of shareholders and, if they try to cover for the lapses of a CEO who has shown a lack of honesty on non-trivial matters, they will be just as culpable as the immediate wrongdoer. Moreover, they will permit a corporate culture to develop that is indeed corrosive and that could easily lead to serious wrongs committed under their watch.<p>This is not merely an issue of legal liability. Yes, a board that knowingly countenances corruption may be legally culpable. But that is not the main point and the author focuses on this nicely. It is an issue of <i>integrity</i>. \"Integrity\" comes from a Latin root meaning \"whole\" (we get the word \"integer\" from that same root). The idea of wholeness in ethics is that what is reflected in a part will reflect the entirety of what is there. That is why it is always dangerous to look the other way when wrongdoing occurs among those holding positions of authority. We can excuse the lapse but what does this reveal about the person doing it. If he lapses here, will he not lapse elsewhere? If it is a peccadillo, maybe that is one thing. But if it does involve a serious moral lapse, that is quite another, especially if willfully done. Does such a person deserve continued trust? From a board perspective, the answer should be no. Not for legal reasons but for ethical. Whatever corporations are, they are better for upholding the highest standards possible insofar as the nature of the institution permits.<p>One final illustration to emphasize why legal liability is not alone enough to check wrongdoing and why an ethical standard ought to prevail: What about a startup controlled by investors on a board following several rounds of funding. What happens when, as the bubble is bursting, they vote to use company money to \"acquire\" other of their portfolio companies that do not in fact warrant being acquired, thereby bleeding the company on whose board they sit for the benefit of their separately owned private investment fund. The board votes are all taken very legally (at least in form), with each investor representative abstaining in the instances where his own fund is concerned but otherwise voting for the other guy's payout, with the net result that the company is effectively bled out for the benefit of the various investors sitting on that board and all at the expense of that company's shareholders (all done under the supervision of a prominent law firm representative). Is this legal? Who knows, but it is very hard to do anything about it legally. Is it ethical? Absolutely not. Yet, this is precisely the sort of thing that happens when ethics are disdained in a business context - indeed, in such cases, the person who refers to ethics is typically regarded as an unsophisticated rube. This is where such things lead when ethics are discarded in favor of pure money goals, as (by the way) often happened during the bubble.<p>HP is no model company in this respect. I have seen this company do some pretty questionable things over the years. Yet the HP cultural carryover from \"Bill and Dave\" days <i>is</i> something to be admired and, insofar as that is reflected in the points made by the author, is worthy of being emulated.<p>This author's views probably represent a minority position in today's business environment but I for one commend them. Integrity <i>does</i> matter over time and it will show itself one way or the other in how any management plays itself out.",

That's the point I gravitated towards as well, there really is a similar playful yet polished vibe from several New York startups like Vimeo, Boxee and Tumblr, off the top of my head.<p>As for the main point of the article - couldn't disagree more, from my personal use case. I'm a Bay Are startup geek but also a designer, so hopefully my biases cancel each other out. I like Tumblr's look but abandoned it after a few days because I didn't want to get sucked into their community features. I'm not a big fan of design subcultures like deviant art or livejournal, really the only online community I've been attracted to and stuck around for is HN. And it's a pet peeve of mine when sites or apps have only good import tools and not export, it's like they want to pretend the identity you've built up around the rest of the web doesn't exist. I'd rather see better integration with my <i>existing</i> networks elsewhere - that's where posterous' autoposting feature really impressed me.

      "Maybe I can connect the dots for you. Optimization is the general problem of finding the minimum of some function f in a region. The problem with this is that it's <i>hard</i>. One of the reasons why it's hard is that f could have many <i>local minima</i>. So we look for conditions on f that make the problem easier.<p>That's where convexity comes in. There are two different things that can be convex: sets and functions. Convexity of sets and convexity of functions is related but not the same. Convexity of sets is well explained by the pictures on wikipedia. A <i>function</i> is convex if for any two points you choose, the value of the function stays below the line that connects these two points.<p>An example of a convex function is e^x: <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e^x\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=e^x</a>\\nTake any two points on the graph and connect them with a line. The graph of e^x will stay below that line.<p>An example of a function that is not convex is sin(x): <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin+x\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin+x</a>\\nYou can find two points on the graph such that if you connect them with a line sin(x) will go above that line. For example x=0 and x=pi.<p>If the function is convex then it will have only 1 minimum. So what you can do to find the minimum is just start at an arbitrary starting position and walk down hill and you will arrive at the minimum of f if f has a minimum. Note that if f had <i>two</i> local minima at different heights you might end up stuck in the higher minimum if you apply this method.<p>Now there are several techniques to walk down hill. One thing you could do is approximate f by a <i>line</i>. This tells you the slope of f at the point you're standing, so you know which direction is down hill. You walk a small step in this direction and repeat. This is gradient descent.<p>Another way to do it is to approximate f by a <i>parabola</i>. A parabola has a minimum that can be computed exactly. So you compute the minimum of the parabola and jump to it. Because it was an approximation this minimum will generally not be exactly f's minimum, but close. So you repeat the process to get closer and closer. This is Newton's method.<p>A complication is that many optimization problems have constraints on the parameters of f. For example f(a,b) could represent the profit you get from investing a dollars in product 1 and b dollars in product 2. But you only have 10 dollars so the constraint is a+b <= 10. If you just start looking for the maximum of f by taking steps or jumping around you will have to keep in mind that a+b cannot go above 10.<p>Another complication is that f may not be differentiable, which makes it harder to compute a line approximation and even harder to compute a parabola approximation.<p>There are books written on solving these issues. This one is available online: <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/</a>",

      "But the point of these AAA ratings is that they are the 'top slice' of a pool of lower rated debt.<p>Suppose a typical student is has around $50 in their wallet at any one time : Demanding $50 from a student is pretty risky, and so is demanding $25.  But if I have a large enough room full of students (say 100), demanding $2500 from the room (which on average holds $5000) is much less risky than requiring $25 from each person.<p>That's how AAA securities can be built from bad credits : Not everyone goes bad at the same time.<p>So the argument should not be about how crazy the idea of bad credits allowing the creation of good credits.  The argument is about correlation coefficients.<p>Moodys / S&P / Fitch got the correlation coefficients between subprime borrowers completely wrong, because they believed that house prices could not all simultaneously decline in the US.  And the investment banks had no incentive to explain the errors of their ways to them - and people who weren't \"On-Side\" at the rating agencies were relegated to lower-growth areas.  And the regulators had no clue.<p>And here we are.",

      "I can't disagree with this more.<p>1) Most bigger open source projects have a core team. Think about the jQuery team for example. Often, the release candidates are intended for the core team, not the general user.<p>2) General users of a particular project generally know better than to use RC's in production. They might not be part of the core team, and unless they are going after a specific feature or bug, will ignore RC's and go with latest stable releases.<p>3) Release Candidates are supposed to be feature complete. If a user needs to start testing their applications against new features being introduced can usually do so early against Release Candidates. So contrary to the author's statement, indeed you can expect 3rd party engineers doing those kinds of integration tests to file bugs when things aren't working right. I've certainly done it, and I imagine many devs on HN have too.<p>4) If you want to look at a situation where you <i>don't</i> get Release Candidates, remember how often Facebook changed and broke Facebook Connect over the last couple years. It is <i>not</i> fun having to re-architect your FB integration 3x within a matter of a few months because they just pushed code live with little or no warning."

      "I've been working with Linux for many years (Ubuntu is my main desktop right now). Ubuntu's gem package simply isn't compatible with the latest version of Rails which means you have to install rvm and figure out lots of stuff.",
      "My suspicion is that the \"killer app\" is an artifact of the super-balkanized era of computing, the era when every vendor's machines ran a different bespoke operating system. That was true in the mainframe era, and it was true <i>in spades</i> in the early PC era, when the IBM PC and the Mac and the Apple II and the Amiga and the C64 and several dozen vendor-specific flavors of Unix all coexisted, all with different OSes and radically different hardware.<p>Just from the evidence, it seems clear that porting software is still hard, but nowhere near as hard as it used to be. There's been some convergence in hardware and operating systems. The rate of turnover in these things has slowed way down. But perhaps the biggest reason is that our hardware and the abstractions built on top of it are now so powerful that large classes of apps -- the ones that don't push the limits of the hardware -- have become trivial to port. The term \"killer app\" was invented around the time of Visicalc; Visicalc was written in highly tuned assembly language so that it would fit in 20K of RAM (no, that is not a typo!):<p><a href=\"http://www.frankston.com/public/?name=ImplementingVisiCalc\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.frankston.com/public/?name=ImplementingVisiCalc</a><p>Nowadays you can implement Visicalc in Javascript and run it on any platform with a customer base larger than five, while routinely creating temporary variables that are ten times the size of Visicalc's entire codebase.<p>So the modern strategy is to test your software on one platform, and then if it takes off port it to the others. So why don't more people start on Android and port to iOS, rather than vice versa? Maybe it's the vaunted fragmentation problem, but I'd guess that it's mostly because iOS is where the money is. There's an app distribution model and a store. That makes it easier to iterate there. Release the app on iOS and see if it floats or sinks. Then spend your Android-porting energy -- figuring out an ad-based model, testing on many different devices, marketing to all those Android users who don't know what \"Android\" means -- on the winners.<p>There are other potential sources of killer-app lock-in. Hardware is one. People who want hardware keyboards can't choose iOS. But that market doesn't seem to have enough size for its killer apps to make news -- particularly because only a subset of Android phones have keyboards, and those keyboards are all different.<p>There's one very obvious Android killer app: Verizon. Not exclusive for much longer, though, if the rumor mill is accurate.",
      "I was going to complain about the poster editorializing again in the title then noticed who the article was from.",
      "No, I love my kids and they don't cloud my judgement.  I mean kids work well with routines and what is wrong with going to work at the same time every day and coming home at the same time?",

      "What has that got to do with <i>introspection</i>?",
      "Incidentally, the web has failed because there are 5 different major browsers, and personal computers have failed, because there is an infinite combination of available hardware.<p>How could anyone have tested on all those?  How could anyone have ever developed a working web application?  How could anyone have ever developed a working Windows application?<p>The non-sarcastic answer: most of the time, the differences are irrelevant.  The rest of the time, you need to build an abstraction, and then the second case becomes the first!  Forever!<p>(Android is open-source.  If you need a function that only Android 2.2 has, backport it to 1.6!  If you need an abstraction layer for dealing with 24-bit or 16-bit screens, write one and share it with the world!  Android is open, and you have to exploit that fact to be successful.  You can't go off into your own little Universe where there is one person with one phone running one app at a time.  That may be the iOS strategy, but it's not what works for Android.)"

      "Ideally we should use the right tool for the job, but sometimes time constraints pressure us to try to use the tool we know best for any job, and the next thing you know we're using a wrench to twist a nail into the wall.  We might get it in there, but it's ugly, crooked, and likely to fall apart with little weight, and all because we didn't have, or didn't want to take, the time to learn to use a hammer.<p>To be fair, one equally shouldn't try to program in Java with python on the brain, it's going to turn out just as hideous and slow, and the developer will probably be more furious at the number of recompilations caused because approach the problem with the right mindset.",

      "\"If you want to evaluate results, why measure hours?\"<p>I dunno-- saying that you shouldn't measure time spent as long as people get their deliverables done feels like saying that you don't need to track where you spend your money as long as your business is making a profit. Time is a really valuable resource.<p>Most people suck at time management, and should get better.  Most managers have no clue how much (or how little) their team works or how workplace variables (like office layout and team composition) change how people spend their time.  Most managers aren't good at guessing what an appropriate list of deliverables for a given full-time employee.  If they try to dole out equal workloads to two developers, what happens when the manager screws up on their time estimates?  Renegotiation mid-week?  How does Dev2 feel when Dev1 gets to go home early?  Who gets the bugs/tasks that have risk associated with them?  Does SeniorDev get harder/riskier tasks than JuniorDev?  Does he get more tasks?<p>The ROWE concept reminds me of fixed-price bids from my consulting days.  To successfully give a fixed price bid with the least risk, you have to do MUCH more careful cost analysis.  With a ROWE system, you have to have a pretty perfect handle on the \"cost\" of the bugs/tasks you pass around (which, with most knowledge work, is nigh impossible).<p>Startups kick ass because (among other thing) the founding team really cares about what they're doing-- I think it's pretty rare for a founder to say on a Wednesday, \"Well, crap-- I finished all of the stuff we said I'd do this week.  I'm off to the slopes!\".  Instead, they say, \"I'm on a roll and there is an endless to-do list.  Time to hit the next item!\".<p>Don't get me wrong-- I think the punchclock mentality is ridiculous.  But I think we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater-- You should measure BOTH.",

      "> That means Google most likely really, really wants to buy Twitter. (So does Facebook, but we'll get to that in a second).<p>I think part of the appeal of Twitter is that it is <i>not</i> a Google or Facebook property. A way to search content without going through Google. Real-time search can be really helpful, even if there is an echo-chamber effect at times. I find interesting people to follow constantly with 'SDK' as my Summize keyword. Plus, it appeals to at least two of the seven deadly sins (pride and possibly envy). I hope that they stay independent and start experimenting with revenue generation models."

      "An additional issue with supersonic is it doesn&#x27;t save you time waiting in line at the airport or driving to and from.

Either way, you&#x27;re probably tired from the trip and won&#x27;t be particularly productive, so why not pay less money for a more comfortable seat in a bigger, slower jet?<p>(While I never flew Concorde, I did babysit one in a museum.

If there is no cure, what was his main role? Can&#x27;t he be easily &quot;replaced&quot; by another brave person that is also willing to risk his life?<p>On another note, the article says that ebola has killed 600 people. Apparently this strand of ebola &quot;only&quot; killed 63% of the people that contract the disease. So far 964 people contracted the disease in a country of more than 6 million people.

      "> The idea that webservers are \"all about side effects\" gives me a chill. The whole architecture concept of HTTP is no side effects, so to claim that it's all about side effects seems odd. It should only be the case for POST PUT or DELETE methods, and only in very specific ways.<p>There's nothing incongruous about that. It <i>is</i> the case that side effects should only happen on POST, PUT, and DELETE methods (and the like), but almost all webservers are written because of a need to use these.<p>If your webserver is all GETs and HEADs, then it is either trivial and you would have used someone else's instead of writing your own, or its sole purpose is to repackage and serve existing data from other sources - a rare use case among all webservers.<p>If you were to take an inventory of all the webservers out there, you would doubtless find that almost all of them exist in large part in order to create side effects.",
      "You didn't read the thread. He's suggesting doing human studies <i>instead of</i> animal studies.",
      "I think his point is that there's usually a very strict ordering to the events on an HTTP server - you parse and sanitize your input, make some database calls, and generate a response - at best, letting something else do the sequencing and composition for you doesn't gain you much, as it might in a reactive GUI. At worst it leaves room for subtle bugs or code that's less clear (arising from the statefulness of the Promse object itself).<p>Using a Promises, as opposed to reducing a list of computations async-style, also limits you to the Promise object's interface, so you lose (or at least add cruft to) the flexibility and composability of using native lists. By sequencing computations with lists, if I want some insight into what's happening, I just List.map(apply compose, logFunc). With promises, I have some work to do.<p>Promises have their uses, but it's definitely a tradeoff, and for most HTTP servers, I'd argue that their utility does seem a bit limited. I'd similarly say that making a point of using FRP to build a server would probably be a bit overkill for the task.",

With a bit of tweaking, with a few different Plamsa theme, Oxygen, and Oxygen color schemes, you can customize it if you like and it looks great out of the box even if you don't. Between that, Qt5, SDDM and plans shaping up for KF5, I'm really excited about the direct of KDE Plasma.<p>KWin has more features than Mutter and is more stable than compiz. It has several interesting features related to the application menus, Plasmoids are actually fairly nifty and useful if you're into that sort of thing. And to top it off, a default Kubuntu install uses a little less than .5GB of RAM at the plasma desktop.",
      "I think the problem with macros is that they do not always compile and do not always work fine. Debugging macros is hard by any definition, because you have to reason about both what is written and what goes on behind the scenes. A macro is great if the same genius is both writing the macro and using it, otherwise it sucks, in practical terms.\\nWith a function things are much easier  one know what gets in, and you can tell the author of the function what has gone wrong; much easier then trying to understand how the macro did unwind; with macros the additional complexity is that one has to understand what the user of the macro was trying to do.",

Seems logical that's what the middle button should be for, but there isn't any sort of guidance on this in the api.<p>2) my game is developed using unity, and runs on android (it's in the google play store).   We get my game building using the official Ouya plugin, but without dev hardware, our ability to test is extremely limited, but we do our best to plug in an xbox controller and make sure everythign works.    ....  so we submit the game to ouya, and they reject it citing \"the game takes turns every one second after starting, and the music keeps playing after exiting the game\".....    since my game doesn't actually have \"turns\", and we use Unity as an engine so don't actually do anything special for exiting, I emailed them back asking for clarification ... and got no response.<p>rant:  they name the controllers buttons OUYA.  wtf seriously?  they couldn't use ABXY?"

Without the first, you end up in the local maximum you describe, without the latter you land in the \"talk is cheap\" box.<p>My post is about the fact that you can in fact leave your job and go through a phase of prototyping one product after another, and deliberately testing each idea for not just how great it sounds but how buildable it is.",

      "As mappu mentioned, I was inadvertently paraphrasing Alexander Stepanov, who said it better than I can:<p>I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interestingsaying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all.<p>Most of my work has been in game dev and languages, so I may be biased, but the problems I encounter tend to be about 90% dataflow, constraint satisfaction, events, and logic programming, and 10% sequential/imperative code to string it all together. OOP (again, in the Java sense) <i>can</i> model the non-sequential parts, but its just sort of awkward and unpleasant.<p>I find OOP technically unsound. It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebrasfamilies of interfaces that span multiple types.<p>I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axiomsyou start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms. Only when you understand them well, can you come up with an interface that will let them work.<p>You cant come up with an interface until you know that it actually corresponds to anything. The defining feature of OOP is also its greatest weakness: that it bakes interfaces into datatypes. Modularity is crippled and change is prohibitively difficult, resulting in extensive workarounds (and a proliferation of design patterns).<p>But ultimately, programming is about what you create with it. We can argue about languages and paradigms all day, or we can just make cool stuff however works best for us.",

For a well polished 2d game have a look at Cavy Story.",

I guess if Goldman's involvement turned out to be as bad as I fear, it can be explained by them finding holes in the regulation where they were the only dominant player. They were able to act (as in the foot market) with no one challenging their doings. No regulation, no competition meaning they were able to game the system as they pleased.<p>Somehow I hope all this information about Goldman's involvement is correct, because it would give clear directions on how to fix the macroeconomic problems the world (not just America) faces. It would clearly show how to adjust the legal system, enforcement.",

I still have the right to bitterly complain about rampant corruption in politics and even be pessimistic about reform happening.<p>> There exist honest, well-meaning, hard-working people working in government and politics to attempt to fix these issues. Unfortunately they're outnumbered by people like you, who tar all of them with same brush you use for the most corrupt business lobbyist.<p>I don't see how the OP's attitude affects the good people working to fix the issues. They clearly want the same thing the OP does. If they think he's wrong--prove him wrong! Get things reformed in his lifetime.",

      "Apes do image processing too; that is from a time before intelligence.<p>The meaning of one's mind being born specialized is that either it's incapable of some functions (not universal), or it's pre-loaded with enough complexity to make some functions easier and others harder. And further, the claim has to go on to say that we don't put layers of abstraction over this and do whatever we want anyway, low level complexity be damned. Do you have an argument this is the case?<p>You give language instinct as an example. So, do you have any argument that our DNA contains knowledge to facilitate language in particular? But perhaps more importantly, an argument that this is done differently for different people, in such a way as to cause differences in adult personalities?",
      ">So I don't know specifically why it is that parents, and others, discourage girls from business and technical areas in particular.<p>Not only technical areas, but also particular technical areas. What makes experimental physics less technical than theoretical, and chemistry less technical than physics?<p>Also, if you look at the percentage of women in technical fields, it does look like cultural barriers dropped. I.e., over the same timeframe that cultural barriers dropped in medicine, they dropped similarly in physics/engineering, causing women to increase from about 1970-1990. After 1990, the % women was roughly flat in all fields: in medicine at 50%, in physics at 20%.<p>Basically, womens liberation had the same <i>qualtitative</i> effect on physics that it had on medicine; only the magnitudes differ.<p>This strongly suggests that some other factor is keeping women out of technical fields. It could be cultural, but it's a completely different type of cultural barrier than the one that kept women out of medicine and physics up until the 1990's. It could also be biological, I don't see much evidence for or against that.<p>>One thing I can tell you is that women working in a field does not imply the problem is solved. First, they might be less skillful, on average. But second, they might have had to put in more effort to achieve the same level of skill, and that could be very hard to detect.<p>Lots of difficult to measure things are possible. I'll wait for evidence of them.<p>(*) By the way, I'm using physics/EE as a proxy for all technical fields, since I've been forced to sit through lots of meetings on that topic. Speaking openly in those meetings was frowned upon...",

And for the same reason, men have to try harder. On wikipedia they say \"men take more risks\" - yes, because they have no choice. Either they impress a woman, or all was futile anyway.<p>On the other hand, I am pretty sure it is a LOT easier for women to have sex, whenever they want. Check this experiment: <a href=\"http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Top/experiments/P10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Top/experiments/P10/</a> (#18)<p>Men and women were walking across a campus asking strangers flat out if they would like to have sex with them. Men were almost always rejected. Women almost never. I claim that the reason for that is not solely cultural.",
      "Advisers can be amazing.  At a friend's startup, they have a few advisers that meet with them weekly and also do weekly intros to prospective clients.

      "That's the same kind of argumentation the creationists use \"see how complex life is, surely it could not just have developed by chance\". Well duh, but it has. What do you know about how many genes are required for a behavioral difference? I am really asking you! Don't just throw around numbers like \"surely xyz genes can not be enough to make a difference\". I think just one gene can be enough in some cases. Maybe some hormone has a higher concentration in the blood of person A than in person B, and zing, totally different personality. Or whatever - I am not a biologist, but I suspect that neither are you."

If we'd sold our app for $5.99, we would have made a tidy profit on solid initial sales and moved on to make another application. However, at the $5.99 range we're competing with much more polished and comprehensive applications.

But in this brave new world of accelerometer location-aware streaming video social network 3D compass games, Scrabble simply can't command the $25 it used to.<p>Developers are just scratching the surface of what can be done with the hardware in a latest-gen smartphone.  2D bitblitting and 16K WAV SFX aren't going to pull in millions anymore.

      "Your definition is good enough, but \"synergy\" actually comes from Buckminster Fuller who built a philosophical system mostly around the idea in the 1950s through early 1970s.  The business community got it from him, largely, from what I heard, by way of a bunch of leftish techies that were associated with him and Black Mountain College in the sixties.",
      "This is great, but the low contrast between the text and the background makes it very hard to read.<p>With no evidence I feel that this is something of a trend at the moment; I've recently battled our designers when they have sacrificed readability.<p>I'm 29 and have excellent vision, I can't imagine how hard this could be to read for people who don't.",

      "> Pascal's Wager isn't comparable here for a number of reasons.<p>Please provide them.<p>> Hence my own estimate of at least 5%.

It's like the Drake equation, except at least with the Drake equation there are some terms we actually know.<p>> It's still a better shot than being buried or cremated and worth it given the low prices available today.<p>Every dollar you pay for cryonics is a dollar that you're depriving your actual living children or family members, or it's a dollar you're depriving yourself of in the past modulo time value of money.<p>> Cryonics is a pretty poor business to be in if you're a charlatan. Where are you getting that vibe from?<p>It's the perfect business to be in if you're a charlatan! There's no way to tell if you're doing a good job or a bad job, you never have to provide any results (because those happen in the distant and undefined future), and your customers are already dead.<p>> I'm not going to touch your horrid comment that death is somehow necessary for progress.... Cryophobia is pure evil. It makes people choose death instead of cryonics.<p>Maybe it is horrid, but is it true? Ah, you don't even bother addressing that. Because as we all know, the most rational response to an argument is to accuse your opponent of \"evil\". It seems to me that even if you dress it up in science fiction and call it \"rationality\", religion is still religion.",

It would slow growth, but endless growth isn't sustainable anyway.

At least in the short and medium term (probably at least the next few centuries) you would be able to have mild to moderate economic growth without deflation as the gold supply increased.<p>The best argument I've heard against gold-based currencies is that is mis-allocates resources: it creates a huge incentive to go around digging up gold, which is an activity serving no real useful purpose.

And it requires the developer to repeatedly do research, which breaks his focus. The developer needs to write more code for an ugly format, and optimizing and maintaining such code becomes difficult. If the code is organically evolving (alongside the format), then with each iteration, fewer and fewer people understand the entirety of the code and format, and fewer and fewer people are able to bring good ideas to the table. The developer is angry, confused, mired in a bunch of ugly code, and alone. He will never produce his best work.<p>None of this is to bash Adobe for producing PSD. Every organization of sufficient age has eldritch code. It is arcane and ancient, and if you look at it the wrong way, it will crumble to dust and blow away in a sudden wind. The problem is arguing that it doesn't matter if mere mortal developers cannot understand it, or that there are no concrete benefits to end users from producing clean internals. The detriments of ugly internals may not be directly visible to users, but users definitely see the ripples on the surface.",

      "Yes that is the contradiction - an apparently great educational system paid for by taxes that are so high that the smart and successful Danes leave the country and make their money elsewhere in order not to pay the high taxes.",
      "I also have to point out being Danish myself that the Danish education system is under heavy attack in Denmark as being uncompetitive.<p>I'm too lazy to google it right now but I remember Danish test results being amongst the worst in Europe.<p>That said I think Denmark has good enough education and improving it is the least of our problems.<p>Denmark has had several high profile people in Computer Science. What is interesting is that they have almost without exception been forced to find a home outside Denmark.<p>Danish culture is very conformist. And it's IT culture doesn't disappoint here. J2EE with Struts and the Waterfall Development model is still seen as cutting edge. Mainframes (proof that we were advanced a few decades ago) are still in wide use in even relatively small companies.<p>I know lots of great Ruby, Python etc programmers there, who are frustrated beyond belief at the lack of momentum for such languages there. I keep preaching to them to start companies.<p>The funny little secret about the Scandinavian model is that at least for Denmark and Norway it has essentially been funded by North Sea Oil. Most Danes don't even know this, but it is reported every year by the ministry of finance. They have also been hit really hard by the recession and I'm not sure how they are going to do with lower oil prices now.",
      "The suspected culprit was the chief IT person at the company, and I think we're being led to believe he was both clever and motivated.  USB disks would likely contain garbage data N days before the culmination of the sabotage, where N is whatever it takes to make sure the full rotation schedule gets ruined.<p>On the other hand, it probably isn't a coincidence that this happened to someone who had no backups at all.",
      "PHP too (Rasmus Ledorf).<p>But where do all these people you mention live now? On the other side of the Atlantic.<p>Another success story is Skype, which was founded by a Dane and a Swede. Did they decide to start the company in Denmark or Sweden? No, it's a Luxemborg company.<p>Denmark has a history of a relatively free economy. In the 1960's the government was smaller than in the US. And the biggest companies in Denmark today were founded a long time ago. Before the welfare state in Denmark grew really big. Maersk, the biggest container shipping company in the world, for instance.<p>Today the average child born in Denmark is going to be a net cost to the Ponzi scheme called the welfare state. So it's an unsustainable system. I think the country is still coasting on the culture and work ethic of the previous generations. But the work ethic is deteriorating now that the welfare state has been around so long there are families where the parents have always lived from welfare and never really had a job.<p>It still \"works\" despite the big government, not because of it. Also, it could be worse, Denmark is #11 on the Economic Freedom Index. It is easy to start a company, there are relatively few restrictions on investment etc. But - the taxes are very high.\\n<a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/countries.cf...</a><p>Denmark has something a similar to Milton Friedmans idea of a school voucher system, where you can put your kid in a private school and you'll get a subsidy from the state. So you kind of get the taxes paid for government school back and the private school gets the money. The parents just have to pay a smaller fee to the private school in addition to the government \"voucher money\". There is no good reason why government should run the school. But they do. Some of them are private though. So if you think Denmark's school system is so great, maybe you should support getting the government out of schools in the US.<p>- another Dane who left Denmark.",

No stock options for anyone?<p>I think a better attitude would be: \"I will give up equity only if it raises the likelihood and magnitude of success\".<p>Some of your comments after your post see to indicate that you feel that it's easy to get funded (it's not) and that you have to give up \"creative control\" of your business when you take funding (you don't).

      "First: Not all jews would agree with those answers as being OK.<p>Second: you need to understand that the main thing going on here is that non jews (who do not need to keep shabbos) are pressing the buttons, etc.<p>And normally that would be enough - no need for batteries and resistors.<p>But it's in israel, and in israel non-observant jews run the power plants, so what happens is that by going in the elevator the jew is causing another jew (in the power plant) to violate the shabbos, and that's a huge problem. (I suppose it's actually the non-jew who is causing it. That's not a problem for the non-jew, but a jew should not use an elevator knowing it's going to cause someone to violate the shabbos.)<p>That's why they added all the batteries and stuff, and that's also why it's not simply a joke. The \"loophole\" if you will is the non-jew pressing the buttons, and that's fine. Non-jews are not required to keep shabbos, and you'd be all set. But the jew must not cause another jew to violate the shabbos, hence disconnecting from the grid.<p>You might ask: what about lights and stuff that are left on? And indeed there are those who run on batteries all shabbos. But the majority say that the jew is not doing any action by leaving the light on, and it's only actions that are a problem. For example: everyone agrees that it's ok to leave a fire running on shabbos, as long as you don't make it larger or smaller, same with the lights.",

      "I'd actually argue the best approach is to develop both sides fully: I agree that an OO data model is the best fit for non-trivial application logic, but I also believe relational databases make the best data stores.  The two can coexist just fine, it's just a matter of selecting the proper design patterns and supporting libraries -- which is why I mentioned SQLAlchemy.  In its developer's words:<p>\"SQL databases behave less like object collections the more size and performance start to matter; object collections behave less like tables and rows the more abstraction starts to matter.\"<p>This false dichotomy that's always presented is distracting, and leads to people naively taking religious positions about what should in fact be a non-issue.",

In C code, how do you encode error returns?  Who has the responsibility of printing error messages or notifying the user of a detected error?  It would be great if these aspects of a system could be exercised as part of automated software testing, and I believe this would be facilitated by language features that could interact with test case datasets to simulate exceptions.",

So the prior odds for likes/hates are:<p>4:6<p>Then it turns out that, of the 40 items the user liked, 4 of these or 10% are tagged \"green\", and of the 60 items the user hated, 12 of these or 20% are marked \"green\".  So the likelihood ratio for \"green\" is:<p>0.1:0.2  (Given that an item is hated, the user is twice as likely to tag it \"green\" than if the item is liked.)<p>Then it turns out that of the 40 items the user liked, 8 or 1/5 are tagged \"red\", and of the 60 items the user hated, 3 or 1/20 are tagged \"red.  So the likelihood ratio for \"red\" is:<p>4:1  (Given that an item is liked, the user is four times as likely to tag it red.)<p>Consider a new item tagged \"red\" and \"green\".  The posterior odds equals the prior odds times the likelihood ratios:<p>16:12<p>57% probability of liking it, claims Naive Bayes.<p>Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<p>If multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio doesn't seem justified as a way of getting the answer, see <a href=\"http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes</a> - there ought to be a shorter version of this, but I haven't gotten around to writing it.",

The book’s main point was the necessity of listing short-, medium-, and long-term life goals, then categorizing them in order of their importance, with the A group being the most important, the B group next, and the C the last, then listing under each goal specific activities designed to achieve them. I still have that paperback book, now almost thirty years old. And I’m sure I have that old list somewhere buried in my papers, though I can’t find it. However, I do remember the A list. I wanted to be a good man, have a good marriage and children, have good friends, make a successful political life, and write a great book.</i>",

      "I've been building up a javascript library to do this, as visualizizing results/data takes up more than half my research time.<p>Unfortunately, this library is nowhere close to ready to be released, but I can describe roughly the architecture, in case it's useful to you.<p>I take all my data and write a python script which will dump it to a .JSON file. This includes the raw data/results, names of different fields, groups of fields to toggle on/off together, and what kinds of visualizations I want to use with a given set of data (view as numbers, as bar graph, as line graph, as linear time-series data, as color-coded images, etc.)<p>Then I have a standard html + javascript file in which I simply load in this JSON file. Because I've prespecified the format of the JSON file (I.e., what fields it has and how the data is stored), I only need to customize a few functions to display results. Things like filtering data, searching and sorting I get \"for free\", since they're in the library.<p>The main advantages:<p>- Interactive browsing of data in various formats, all in the web browser, with no plugins etc. required.<p>- Can be viewed locally or across the network<p>- No need for a server to be running<p>- Processing done on each local computer, as opposed to on some server<p>- HTML 5 is now good enough (just barely) to offer all the kinds of interaction I require<p>- Most of the code is in my standard library for visualizations, and so the time to create a new visualization for a new set of data is quite small.<p>Drawbacks:<p>- HTML 5 is still slow<p>- Can't do very advanced stuff yet, without writing a lot of custom code. On the otherhand, using jQuery + jQuery UI, it's very easy to make things draggable, for example, to compare various things side-by-side or even on top of each other (with transparancy)<p>- No server, so can't \"save\" complicated settings or parameters (although cookies help).<p>Anyway, in case you end up building something of your own, hopefully some of these ideas might help.",

The opportunity cost of this time only compounds the first problem.<p>Edit: Sorry, I should have been more clear. In terms of cost, I meant that there's an institutional problem within the American education system that allows for such skyhigh tuition rates.<p>The same reasoning applies to time. Sure, students can ramp up their classes and finish a 4 yr degree in 3 yrs, but why should they have to? Why not make it 2-3 yrs to begin with? This can easily be done by making non-relevant classes optional instead of core for a given major (for example, I had to take a course in art as part of my biology major)."

The product requires network effects to maintain its near-monopoly position in the corporate world, and having a significant portion of people in \"document sharing\" networks say, \"I don't have Office\" is a threat.  So, what Microsoft's quietly made decision says to me is that they are worried that a sufficiently large enough portion of computer users were both unwilling to pay for Office and unwilling to bother pirating it.<p>On Black Friday, many online retailers were running specials on a Home/Student Office \"Family Pack\" -- three legal installs for $100.

The way I was taught, a progression is called arithmetic because each term is the arithmetic mean of its predecessor and successor, i.e. if A comes before a term X and B comes after a term X in an arithmetic sequence, then X = (A+B)/2. Similarly, a geometric progression uses the geometric mean, i.e. X = (AB)^(1/2).",

It's a wonderful thing, trust me.<p>In reading the other comments I was surprised at how many people would choose the masters degree.  In the end it is just an expensive piece of paper.  It only means something if the next people in line think it does.  Let me be honest and say a startup will likely not care that you have it.  A large company would give you a level jump and with it a 5% raise.  And academia would care the most, but that doesn't sound like the direction you want to go.<p>Now don't get me wrong, college is a great ride and I can see the temptation to hang on just for that.  For me, in hindsight, I can say honestly that the job route was right for me.  I learned about the business of software -- my chosen profession.  I paid off my not-so-small loans.

They change existing APIs and add with every major release -- but they do so in a new SDK.

The compiled binary I downloaded from insecure.org worked against the loopback interface but not against the wifi one. The interface to capture raw frames from the airport extreme changed again with snow leopard, breaking valuable programs like Kismac.

      "Students have <i>always</i> been stupid. The only thing that changes is the reason. It used to be newspapers. Then comic books. Now Google.<p>The hand-wringing and moral panic are always talked up by innumerates who have neither measured the purported decline in student capabilities nor adduced any reason as to why the technology in question creates the purported affect--at least, they never give any reasons that go beyond pandering to the prejudices of their own generation.<p>Generally, technology improves intellectual capabilities. Newspapers informed. Comic books introduce young people to stories they might not have encountered otherwise. Texting improves literacy (what <i>else</i> would you expect from a technology that allows young people to carry on complex social lives entirely via the written word?) and the kind of transparent access to a diversity of information sources that Google provides increases a wide range of intellectual capabilities by giving students access to actual facts to think about, rather than the completely useless contents of their imagination.<p>It is true, as the article says, that certain formerly-important skills will be lost, and the <i>type</i> of mistake we used to make will be replaced by a new <i>type</i> of mistake. But are the new types of mistake more frequent (unlikely, and not mentioned) or more severe (also unlikely, also not mentioned) than the old types of mistake? Strangely, anti-Bayesian articles like this one never even try to do a proper accounting of the number of old-type mistakes avoided by the technology, focusing entirely--and misleadingly--on the types of mistake enabled by the new technology. This is lazy, dishonest and misleading.<p>To put it another way, work-processing has had a terrible effect on typing accuracy, but who cares?",

      "Many years ago someone gave me a <i>self help</i> tape..yeah a cassette ;).  The only thing I recall is the speaker telling a story about him being woken up early in the morning by his father to go work on the family farm.  As a boy, he would sometimes wake up groggy and grumpy, unhappy about milking the cows pre-dawn.  His father would say to him \"Do you want to have a good day, or a bad day?\"<p>Now, I'm a father. My son has an easy life.  No real responsibilities.  But he has his moments of wanting to express his profound unhappiness with what the day holds for him.  So I ask him \"Do you want to have a good day, or a bad day?\"  He tells me he wants to have a good day.  I tell him that we have things to do and it may not be what he thinks he wants, but he can choose if he wants to be happy.  This works surprising well on a four year old.  He is almost seven now and I rarely have to remind him of this choice anymore.",

      "Personally, I really prefer Unity to classic Gnome. Unity is the best desktop experience I have had. I've been using it since 11.04 out. Unity had some rough edges when it was first released, but a lot of that has been ironed out. I really like the direction Unity is going. I feel that it uses space in a more intelligent way. I am very glad that Canonical has taken the initiative to build a better desktop environment. Many people don't like change, and I feel that is the category that many of the people criticizing Unity fall into. I do agree that Unity is not as easily customizable as I would expect, but again, I enjoy most of the decisions that comprise Unity.",

At some point during the second half of this \"presentation\" each slide seemed to have some vague phrase or sentence that was followed by 3-5 screenshots with no explanation of what the relationship was to the context the screenshot was given in -- I started to wonder if substituting those screenshots with random ones would have any impact on the value of the presentation.<p>If anything, I think the awful slideshow \"player\" UI on this website did a better job at explaining the lack of \"invisible design\" than the slideshow did. I spent almost a minute trying to find a play button, because from the look of the UI I was expecting a movie.

      "It is an interesting line of thinking.  Way too many startups I've been involved with/talked to have over looked the role of admins/an ops team.  The mentality seems to be that developers should also focus as admins/ops.  Surely nothing will go wrong on a weekend after a developer has already put in an 80 hour week, right?<p>From my experience, sys admins are important.  If you are doing anything of scale, knowledge on how to setup, tweak, and debug systems is critical.  It is helpful if the admins can stretch a bit into the app layer, just as it is helpful for developers to be able to stretch a bit into the systems layer, problems come up and knowledge of the parts helps.<p>As an engineer that can also setup systems for scale, I know my limits and really appreciate help from and learning things from good sysadmins.",
      "The inverse perspective works too:<p>An employer hires you. Then they come across more candidates. They continue interviewing for the same position. You then find out that they have been interviewing, your loyalty is shaken and you know that the employer can fire you within the trial period which makes the feeling worst.<p>New applicants will not know that the position was filled and get formally rejected if they are not significantly better than you. If they do find out about position being pre-filled, they'll resent the employer for continuing to interview them.<p>Please note that employment culture is very different in many companies and to not take things for granted. Look at Steve Yeegee's recent post regarding Amazon vs Google."

My question is twofold. Are there services into which you can plug for ads?

      "Yeah, very true.  I have an idea about how to detect cheaters, if you want to hear about it.  Basically, I think the way to detect whether someone is cheating in an online game is by applying spam filtering techniques.<p>First consider that every server-side game state (like a player's position in the game world) can be considered a statistic.  So for example, a history of a player's speed at points in time would have certain maximums.  (i.e. \"players don't usually move at 500MPH.  And if they do, they only do so for very short periods of time.\")<p>Therefore, by definition, a cheater is a player whose statistics are significantly different from the norm.  A speedhacker could be detected because his max speed would become way above the \"typical\" maximum player speed over a significant amount of time (like, he begins to run at 500MPH for 2 solid minutes).  So we can then boil the problem of detecting cheaters down to evaluating probabilities (which is the same way spam email is identified).<p>This type of system would also handle the case where there's a game bug that accidentally causes players to run fast -- the system won't accidentally boot everyone, because everyone is now running fast, so therefore that fast movement speed becomes \"normal\".  Now let me point out that the very same thing could be accomplished much more simply by just writing code to boot players when their speed exceeds a certain hard-coded maximum global speed, then being very careful to not introduce a superacceleration bug.  However, that's special-case code, which should typically be avoided.  It also doesn't take into consideration that a player's speed could legally be significantly accelerated for a short period of time by physics, for example, or for a number of other reasons.  The idea is to analyze samples of a number of different game statistics, then boot any player whose maximum statistic value significantly exceeds the normal maximum value over a significant amount of time.<p>This type of system would prevent a situation where a cheater discovers how to manipulate the timing variables in packets, then tricks the server into thinking he's moving faster than he actually should be.  (I believe Counter-Strike: Source is still affected by that particular speedhack problem.)  We would also be able to detect and ban players using aimbots, because it is very statistically significant for a player to murder 20 opponents in 10 seconds, for example.<p>So if people modify the client to cheat, the server will identify and ban them.  Godda love probabilities and statistics.",

I don't goto the New York Times store to buy the paper -- I goto the new stand where the New York Times is just one of many choices. The news stand may only offer a couple dozen choices and not 2,000 but there's a diminishing return at some point. I'm most likely going to pick one of the first 5-10 stories on Google News and that's almost always linking to a popular mainstream publication.",

      "It's an accounting trick. Dell needs to sell a certain amount of goods every quarter. Well they price things to move and load any debt onto next quarters books. Eventually you reach a point like today. Dell has so much debt that it eats into future earnings. This reflects in the stock price. Apple's market cap is 160billion dollars, with 35 billion in reserve. Dells cap is 30 billion dollars. Realistically, Apple could buy Dell in cash.<p>While the deals are great for endusers, they are cutting their own throats to move product. One thing you can't ignore about Apple, they make profit on everything they sell (no loss leaders there). To an investor, that is a good buy.",
      "Indeed it does, and very impressive it is too. I cannot help wondering, though, why it is wearing shoes...unless they want to conceal some ever-so-clever technology.",
      "It's a Computer <i>Science</i> degree, not a <i>programming</i> degree. If you want to learn a trade, go to trade school not a four-year university.<p>You wouldn't expect someone with a degree in English to know how to navigate a book contract, would you?",

      "It does stick out... but apparently too far as it blocked out the following qualification \"(obviously different sectors age at different rates – web programming has a very fast cycle, embedded systems a very slow one)\". C is a systems language, it's been around forever and is not about to be replaced anytime soon, possibly anytime in our lifetimes. It's too good at what it does. And that's why it's taught in a lot of universities.<p>As is Lisp, for the reasons you mentioned. As is SQL. As are several others (though I'd disagree with Java myself because it's really more set up to do things than to teach things and there are too many shortcuts in there - but many others disagree with me on that point :) ).<p>I'm not for getting rid of established languages from courses. C is 37 years old; C++, 30 years; Lisp, 51 years; Objective C, 23 years - these are well-established languages that won't vanish in the four-year span of an undergrad course. Java at only 14 years (and so many releases that stability is a valid question) tends (to my mind at least) to mark the start of the gray area there. Some though, like Perl and C++, are really hard to teach in compared to others and that can outweigh their stability as a factor. Still though, I look at languages like Python and would love to work them into a course. But it is still a risk for the students. Maybe for the final year work though.<p>But teaching a four-year course using Ruby as a primary language, intellectually interesting as that sounds, is an unethical act at the moment. It's a beautiful language, a real joy even to read - but what the students start learning on day one may not be around, or be a useful thing to know for the jobs they'll pay their mortgages with four years down the line. That's the responsibility the university is taking on when it creates a course. The student invests four years of their life - the university must produce a return on that, and conservative thinking is needed for that.",

I had really hoped this would be a general conversation about how people cope with controversy in dealing with \"the public\", whether it's a forum or your own website.  That's part of why I didn't want to go into specifics in my opening post.  I really don't think anyone can tell me what to do about my specific situation.  I was hoping people would tell me what they have found helpful in dealing with their own controversies.  I think that would be both more helpful to me and of more general interest to the audience here.  My very specific niche worries are unlikely to be anything anyone here can really relate to.<p>But thanks for your concern."

      "True story: my wife majored in Musical Theatre in college, and had the privilege of studying with Rocco Dal Vera (http://www.ccm.uc.edu/faculty/facultyProfile.aspx?facultyid=32/), a world-renowned dialect expert.<p>To put in context how freaking awesome this guy is: name a country in the world, and he can perform every dialect in the region <i>flawlessly</i>, as well as tell you how it originated and developed over time.<p>Awesomeness indicator #2: Rocco did the dialect work on the \"Indiana Jones\" movies. 'Nuff said.<p>Yesterday, my wife e-mailed the \"Did Americans in 1776 have British Accents\" post (http://www.nicholasjohnpatrick.com/post/767354896/did-americans-in-1776-have-british-accents) to Rocco. Here's his reply, posted here with his permission:<p>====================<p>That is very cool, and I found most of the post accurate, except at the end when he speculates on why New York and New England may be non-rhotic.<p>There's a small contradiction: if their connections were British and British was itself rhotic, then that doesn’t explain how they lost their Rs. (Except that it could have happened 100 years after the Revolutionary War.)<p>England’s journey toward a non-rhotic prestige accent followed the Revolutionary War, a time when we were pretty cut off from them. We were in a state of almost continual war with them through the war of 1812 and even through the Civil War when they supported the South more than the North.<p>Much later, in Victorian times, wealthy residents of Boston, Philadelphia and New York sent their children to England to be educated and their prestige accents became reflective of those schools’ emphasis on RP. That persisted well through the 1950s (and shows up in accents we call Boston Brahmin, Philadelphia Mainline and New York 400). It may well be that until then New York wasn’t terribly non-rhotic, but I would love to read a real study on this.<p>Immigration also had a huge effect on New York and New England speech. How much that accounts for the rhoticity question is hard to say. But is has to be a factor. Still, the result is surprising because notice how Boston, famously the center of Irish immigration (a heavily rhotic accent, then and today) somehow ended up with a non-rhotic accent in a country that is mostly rhotic.<p>Incidentally, the author doesn’t comment on US Southern prestige accents that were non-rhotic almost from the start. The reason for that? They were raised by their black nannies and African languages are non-rhotic. Southerners hate to hear this, but their prestige non-rhotic plantation accents are the product of slave speech! A lovely topic for the 4th of July as we contemplate liberty...",

The meinheld WSGI server uses it, and I got nearly double requests/second compared to gevent (libevent). Not that that means much, but it's interesting.",

      "My point about science and polticw was that there are attempts for politics to become more scientific, but politicians (along with big business managers, to a degree) want definitive answers, not equivocation and hypotheses that haven't been proven.   Thus we get \"scientists\" guiding them based on their political views, charisma or communication skills, not on the actual evidence.   I am not advocating for anti-intellectualism, but I am notimg that there is a reason for mistrust of science:  it too can be abused to push an agenda by \"acting\" before the science can give you clear answers.  Examples include Jean Mayer and Ancel Keys in nutrition (heavily influenced The first US policy on nutrition via George McGovern in the early 70s); Greenspan in economics (free money for far too long, pushing the belief the financial market wouldn't screw itself over even though they have time and again)<p>On the other hand I'm actually kind of happy that the Internet has made a meritocracy of expertise via blogs and mailing lists - credentials are too easily abused.",

That is, you encounter a brick-wall that only spouts that you are wrong, because (instead of The Bible Says So) \"she was a saint\" or \"he was a pacifist\". And that's as far as you'll get. People who have no investment or interest in either person will be highly offended that you would dare make any assertions.<p>Hyped figures perpetuated by media and society are destined to be remembered this way for eternity and any contradictions -- no matter how scholarly -- will always be categorized as hateful.<p>Oh, if there's a third thing you don't do, it's offer any criticism of Nelson Mandela.<p>Oh, and if there's a fourth thing you don't do, it's offer any criticism of Che Guevara.",

I could've done it at 19, I probably could even have done it at 24, but now that I'm 29, I just can't code for 14 hours a day, let alone 20.  (Actually, that's not entirely true - I've pulled 14 hour days for 4-5 day stretches working on a Google doodle or coming up to a launch, but I need like 2 weeks of recovery time afterwards.)  Alas, I wasted my twenties on college and 3 failed startups.<p>It's certainly <i>possible</i> to start a company in your 30s - PG did it, founding ViaWeb at 31 and selling it at 34 - but it does seem like a bit of an uncanny valley without many founders.  My theory is that people who are the type of person that's going to found a startup probably would've founded it by 26, and then if their first couple attempts failed, they're licking their wounds at 30 and trying to figure out how to give it another go.<p>Those same people often end up starting follow-up ventures much later, after the kids are self-sufficient.  I have one friend from elementary school whose dad is working on his second startup at the age of 70.  His first venture - founded at around age 60 - ended up IPOing at a market cap of several billion before crashing and burning.",

Instead, it adds highly visible layers of functionality and interface on top of the reading experience (that's its draw, after all). When a typical RSS reader opens a full feed, you don't really notice, since the reader's just a vehicle for consumption. But because XYDO doesn't fade in the same way, it feels a lot more like linkjacking.\""

The results were also fairly random.<p>I think it fits the model that once you are large and successful, the trolls will come out of the wood-work. The compliment is that you are big and successful enough to be worth a shakedown. Once you are the $250k to actually defend  (its really more like $1 mil/year for up to 7 years) is chump-change to you at that point. The big problem is the more or less random outcomes of such trials.<p>Until you are making big money, you are not worth the time because a victory would be costly to the victor and you'd have nothing to actually turn over. If they won debt, you'd just close up shop, as there'd be no point in working to pay a troll.<p>When I say that \"there's no such thing as infringement\" I'm not talking in the made-up world of legal types. They could rule you infringing for tying your shoe if they had the right lawyers, I'm speaking from the realistic standpoint that no two software systems are ever really alike unless you outright steal a copy of the source. I've used the example before that 2 computers that factor large prime numbers look form the outside like a pair of beige boxes that do exactly the same thing, but inside they are likely worlds different. This confuses the lawyers, patent officers and uneducated outsiders and leads to the problems that the patent system now faces when it comes to software.<p>When you patent a machine, you have to show its inner workings and they have to be novel. When you patent software, you can pretend that the general purpose computer is the inner workings, and not the actual software. This lets you cheat and patent a concept directly, without proof that the inner workings are novel or even possible.",

      "I have two piece of advice about what technical recruiters should not do, based on my own experience:<p>1. Announce that someone is applying for a job <i>without first asking them if they're interested</i>.  (Yes, this happened to me: I was invited to go somewhere and speak about my research; I agreed; and when I turned up, I was introduced as \"Colin Percival, who wants to work for us\".  To this day I still don't know exactly what job I was \"applying\" for -- I talked about my research and got out of there as quickly as I could.)<p>2. Announce that someone is applying for a job <i>other than the one they told you they were applying for</i>.  (In fact, there were three different positions involved, and in the end I was offered the position I originally applied for -- but not before having a list of on-site interviewers selected on the basis of a different position and then partially reworked on the spot.)",
      "The other dead giveaway is when you are working at an unusual hour. You hear a phone ring down the hall, no answer. Then a phone closer to you. Then one right next door, then your phone rings. The whole sequence is like something out of a cheap horror flick.<p>You eye it with disgust, but pick it up, and sure enough it's a recruiter sequentially dialling through the extensions. And they have the nerve to pretend they are calling just for you!"

With modern brewing equipment you can go grain to glass in as little as 2 weeks. With a whiskey you're talking at least a couple months of aging.<p>When making beer there are 23 major categories of beer. As a brewer you can make mist of those with just different ingredients. When distilling you're focus is usually on only one type of spirit. In that case it's all or nothing.",

I think the majority of porn using men could not. There is an entire subreddit(/r/nofap) dedicated to this one task, and if you read you will see how difficult it really is.",
      "I am. It's pretty amazing. All performance benefits of C, none of the language drawbacks. (No offense to C.)<p>I have a few apps in production already and I'm only doing new stuff in Go.",
      "I didn't get that from the article, really. They could have registered with the S.E.C. without listing on a major exchange.",
      "I'm in a similar boat. I'm a bit older, and my kids are too. One turns 5 in September and the other 2 next month.<p>Since the 5 year old has been born I've started several projects, contributed to a few open source projects and not made a lot of money.<p>My whole goal for side projects was based on wanting to provide more for my family. I thought if I could bring in more money we could move to a better home and I could provide nicer things for them. Funny how after having a kids material possessions of your own mean so little but you want the world from them.<p>Here's what I would do if I could do it all over again. I wouldn't have side projects, I'd have hobbies. I'd not focus so much on the hobbies that it impacted the relationship with my children. I'd worry less about making money right now, and focus more on what my family as a whole needs right now.<p>It's been a slow learning experience for me. Where I'm at now is I still poke around and try to learn. It really is a hobby for me. I like programming and my day job doesn't give me as much opportunity for creative programming as I'd like. I'm a devops sysadmin. I get to play with super expensive engineering projects like Citrix and 6 figure CMS systems. I get to do lots of scripts, implementing chef and nagios. However, I like to build things, so that's what I do as a hobby now.<p>I've dropped all focus from making money on my projects. With me not focusing on money I can drop a project for weeks at a time to focus on other things. Remodeling a bathroom or dealing with the extra running around for my daughters first ballet recital.<p>I also stopped focusing on having enough money to try and get the family to where I want it to be as far as new home right this second. Part of that mindset is why I insisted my wife work after the second baby was born. She didn't work for the first 2 years our 5 year old was born. She was miserable. She hated working and not having that time with the baby, and it was obvious the baby didn't like daycare or being with grammy most the day either. Nothing can replace mommy.<p>In January my wife quit her job. She got an offer for a job making a lot more money, she turned it down. The house is in much better shape. From cleanliness to just over all mood of everyone in the household. I'm all in on my day job 100% and I've been much more productive there because I've only focused on my family and the job. As such, I've gotten decent raises and a promotion in the past few years.<p>Lots of unexpected expenses have come up. I've learned that we don't need to buy a lot, and instead of focused on knocking out doubt and putting extra money into the house so we can slowly prep it to sell while waiting for real estate value to increase. My house depreciated a lot, however I live near DC so we are seeing a recovery.<p>The past few months I've completely stopped focusing on the idea of making money from my projects. It's been extremely hard. I often get the bug that if I just finish the one app I can bring in more money. Something always distracts me, that something usually being something I need to do for the family. I've learned to accept that having that distraction it's what's better for me in my life and for the lives of my kids.<p>One thing I've also realized is that I'm going to have a ton of time later to work on side projects. The level of independence my older child shows compared to the baby is remarkable. Taking the time to focus on the job that provides a regular paycheck while spending the rest of my time being Dad and Husband rather than Entrepreneur is what I believe is best for everyone now.<p>I've also started focusing on myself. My myself I mean my health. I waited until I was in my 30's to have kids. I want to meet my grandkids. I've been eating healthier, getting some exercise and making sure I get enough sleep.<p>When I'm an old man I expect to measure whether I'm a success or not to be the children I raised and not any company I've formed. Maybe I can give my kids the headstart that they can create something amazing before they're ready to settle down and raise a family themselves.<p>Just to be clear, I haven't given up on the side projects. I've just reclassified them. I've still got 2 websites up that work, and I continue to work on them. I'm learning 2 new languages this year. Ruby at work for chef and Go to rewrite one of my python/zeromq apps in to see if it's easier to maintain. Maybe when the kids are older I'll have time to pursue one of my sites as a real business. Heck, I'll probably still make a few stabs at it before they're older. Right now as I write this, I hope I fail for a few more years. It's awesome watching how many new things my kids can learn in a week. It's great being the one to teach them a few of them.",

It says \"I noticed your lapse of etiquette\" and, more importantly, \"I just called you on it.\"  Given that a guest has bought himself coffee, the polite thing to do as the host is to take no notice of the fact.<p>We have <i>manuals</i> for this sort of thing.]",

The technologies existed as separate entities - you post your thoughts on your own page - you use a separate tool to read an aggregated list of other's thoughts. Twitter combined the two into a dead simple interface.<p>The 140 character limit - initially an artifact left over from the days when sms was the primary means of using it - is now more of a practicality issue.<p>You can't show a steady stream of other's thoughts if they all extend to multiple pages.",

Otherwise you are injecting noise for no reason.

      "It is worth remembering that many of Aristotle&#x27;s works begin by covering the whole field as it existed in his time, and it is often difficult to untangle what Aristotle himself thought vs what he reported others thinking. The &quot;standard&quot; translations of Aristotle&#x27;s major works--particularly Metaphysics--by Sir David Ross are also heavily influenced by Ross&#x27; neo-Platonism, so they can be quite misleading given the number of gaps and ambiguities that need to be filled.<p>It is also worth remembering that we know today that Aristotle&#x27;s physics accurately describes human experience. If you inquire into the physical beliefs of non-physicist college students you will find they give accounts that are Aristotelian to the core. The degree to which Newtonian physics is bizarre, abstract and counter-intuitive is often forgotten by people who bash Aristotle. He was often wrong, but the problems he was working on were fiercely difficult, and the tools he had to bring to bear on them incredibly crude by modern standards.",

So, there, in the next to last bar, \\nright before the top of\\nthe climax of the section, Bach touched on\\nthe tonic again!  So, <i>artistically</i> this\\ntied the <i>motion</i> and <i>emotion</i> of the other\\nnotes back to the tonic and not left partly\\nlost out in the ozone -- or some such.<p>This afternoon, I listened to the Heifetz\\nand Piatigorsky performance of the Andante\\nof the Brahms <i>Double Concerto</i>:  Finally it\\ndawned on me:  Brahms had an <i>abstraction</i> \\nof some kind of speech, say, of just the \\n<i>sound</i> of the speech, the sounds that \\nconveyed the emotion without knowing the literal\\nwords.  So, it sounded like speech, maybe like\\nspeech in a foreign language where didn&#x27;t \\nunderstand the literal meaning of the words\\nbut, still, got much of the <i>emotional</i> \\nexpression.  It appears that you have a book\\nthat expands on such a thing.<p>Edit:  Okay, at<p><a href=\"http://www.nsi.edu/~ani/MLB_review_Psychomusicology_Sept_2010.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nsi.edu/~ani/MLB_review_Psychomusicology_Sept_201...</a><p>I found a book review of<p>Aniruddh D. Patel.\\n<i>Music, Language, and the Brain</i>.<p>He&#x27;s deep into some apparently fairly speculative\\nresearch and makes me like more my little idea\\nthat some of music is like listening to some \\npassionate talking in a foreign language were \\nknow none of the words but, still, get the \\nemotional content -- that is, the music and the\\nemotional content of the speech can be similar.<p>So, back to the opening cello solo of the\\nBrahms <i>Double</i>, we can imagine some \\npassionate speaking where a person says\\nsomething, just a few words, then says it\\nagain a little differently, then again with\\na little different emphasis, then again \\nusing maybe different word order.  Well,\\nmaybe \\nthat&#x27;s much of what Piatigorsky playing\\nwhat Brahms wrote is doing.<p>Or, back to the beginning of the D major\\nsection of the Bach <i>Chaconne</i>, we have\\n<i>phrases</i><p>F# G E, F# G A D, E F# G F# E E A F#<p>[this example would be still more clear\\nwith the actual music with the\\nnote timings -- maybe the harmony\\nwould also help!]  Here I am inserting\\ncommas to separate what I am regarding\\nas the separate <i>phrases</i> repeating\\nthe same basic emotional content.<p>So, an idea is that that music is \\nlike a speaker saying much the same\\nthought three times, each time\\nwith mostly the same words and\\nin a similar but different way,\\nthat is, with <i>variations</i>.<p>Why three times\\nwith variations?  The speaker is\\npassionate and, maybe even, <i>pleading</i>,\\nand trying to get their meaning across\\nif not the first way then maybe in one\\nof the two other ways.  Besides, the third\\nway is more complete than the other two\\nand, even, with the rise to the A, has a point of\\nhigh emphasis and emotion.  Maybe.<p>See something similar at the beginning\\nof <i>Silent Night</i> where there are four\\nvariations of basically the same\\nemotional expression.<p>I suspect that Bach and Mozart could \\n&quot;search their feelings&quot; (<i>Star Wars</i>),\\nthink of some corresponding speech,\\nhear the corresponding music, and just\\nwrite it down.<p>The book review suggested that different\\nlanguages have different <i>patterns</i> in \\nthe speaking and, thus, for each such\\nlanguage, music written in that language\\nwill use similar <i>patterns</i>.  So from that\\nmight argue that the Bach <i>Chaconne</i>\\nwas not written by a native speaker of\\nFrench or Greek.  Or Massenet just does \\nnot sound like Bach, Mozart, Beethoven,\\nMendelssohn, Wagner, or R. Strauss!  Maybe\\nMassenet sounds more like Debussy or Ravel!",

It would simply spread operations across more lines.  That also seems like a reasonable thing to ask, to me.  They can learn your <i>method</i> either way.<p>Edit: I mean, I&#x27;m sure fitting more on the screen is valuable, but people already know how to fit many times as much code onto a screen.

People were willing to pay much more than they were asking if only the service were marketed differently, and this company was happy to have the business with me doing the advertising work.

(or perhaps they were). They got involved because the heat was on in Kenya.<p>4: Mocality suffered a loss here (e.g. use of data to be used to solicit businesses against their terms and conditions), the people doing so were at Google and representing Google and thus Google has opened themselves up for a considerable legal mess.<p>5: The Nigerian courts and legal system are too hard/expensive/slow for Mocality and Google to navigate, so Mocality have turned to PR to motivate Google to change.<p>6: That approach is working, and it should be working. Google needs to do something urgently to fix this.<p>7: Getting rid of the partners is insufficient remedy for Mocality. There needs to be some compensation involved for the solicitation of a considerable percentage of Mocality's listings.<p>8: Ultimately the best way for Google to handle this is to purchase Mocality.<p>Questions<p>1:Was the India team a Google team one or outsourced to some rascals there?<p>2: What will Google do to compensate Mocality of this scam?<p>3: Has Mocality retained a lawyer in Nigeria, have they formally asked Google to Cease and Desist and requested compensation?<p>4: Why has Google not approached Mocality wrt purchase of their data?<p>5: Who has the relationship with any businesses that did sign up to the scammers? What will happen to that relationship and to the money paid?",

      "Thanks! I will have fun.<p>Is it different (in math)? Yes and no. There are a bunch of jobs teaching low-level courses (often 3 or 4 a semester) at teaching colleges, most of them in isolated locations, where little or no research gets done. Some people are happy to accept these, some don't want to and take industry jobs. I teach at the University of South Carolina, and with rare exceptions, our Ph.D. graduates work at these kinds of places.<p>I don't know how other fields are, but it is typically predictable how well grad students will do. I think grad students usually know if they have a reasonable shot at making it big (or semi-big as in my case) halfway through grad school, so they don't have to go through eight years of crap to find out.",

The next LTS is when I'll most likely start switching my machines, it will be the 3rd iteration of Unity and the Canonical team appears to try to really get things right on the LTS releases.",
      "In my profession (engineering consulting to VoIP companies), I hear this a lot from customers who are building new companies or products and emphasise that what they need has to be \"low-touch\", and that the \"user experience\" needs to be \"self-service oriented\".<p>This is generally a euphemism for, \"I don't want to hire real support staff\", and to some extent, is understandable given the low margins and race to commoditisation in the general VoIP service provider space.<p>And to some extent, the self-service aspect is objectively more efficient. I wouldn't want to call someone like Vitelity to order my DIDs; I'd rather just order them myself instantly on the web.<p>But there are certain things that you'd rather call or e-mail someone to open a request to address, and then just let go of the problem and let someone else solve it.  I think porting requests rank fairly high on that list, although most of the bureaucratic complications with that are imposed by regulatory requirements--meaning, the task isn't _inherently_ \"high-touch\".  But the point is, these, too, are things that companies are trying to keep from crossing the customer-vendor barrier.<p>I think anyone that can figure out how to get their customers to pay a premium for good service (at a large scale), but still actually provide said good service, wins.",

      "I'm not an expert in Scheme, Clojure, or teaching programming, but here's a few reasons why I don't think Clojure as it is TODAY would be the best language ever for learning programming (I don't really think Common Lisp is either, despite the fact that I loved Land of Lisp).<p>- Clojure has these horribly huge Java stack traces when you hit an error. Newbies are going to run into errors frequently, and they don't know Java. Even I find this kind of frustrating when using Clojure (and I know Java), if only because it's annoying to have to scroll back just to read the error. This could change! I'm sure it will. But it's the state of Clojure today.<p>- Modern function programming and concurrency stuff isn't really necessary for beginners. Sure, teach them purely functional programming to start out with, a la SICP, if that's your thing, but I think that Clojure's concurrency primitives (various reference types, immutable data structures) are a bit too advanced.<p>Scheme is just ever so slightly simpler and I think that matters. Just my 2 c. I love Scheme and Clojure and Lisp, I'm just not experienced with teaching programming to total beginners, so take all this with a handful of salt. I tend to be conservative when it comes to these kinds of discussions and would be happy with new programmers using Python, because it's so much better than Java.",

      "The idea is to be robust around groups, and to be dead simple. So as a beta, I only use facebook because quite honestly that was the easiest way for me to get the product out fast, and get feedback.<p>The key differentiator between this and facebook (right now) is that the album is shared i.e. multiple people who were in the same place/event, and shared the same experience, also share the same album. Basically perfect anytime several people do something together and want to have access to everyone's photos, to share, to print, to store, whatever.<p>Our mobile app will extend this functionality live to events happening in real time and will be a way for hundreds of people, taking pictures at the same event, to have all their photos (instagram/picplz etc) in the same album - the end value in this is that it becomes an additional discovery mechanism for people with similar interests.<p>It's important that we break away from a facebook login for example, but this is really the crux of my question; my goal is to build something robust that a lot of people can use, and I'm torn between depth and breadth; depth being making it more useful to the people currently on it for now (and focusing on functionality/UI before acquiring users) or building out features more slowly, and focusing on acquiring more users.<p>If we focus on depth, we'll have a better product sooner, but less users for now, which means less feedback to react to, less traction etc. If we focus on breadth, it will mean more users more quickly, but it will take longer to realize the vision.",

For the first time in my life I have though it would be nice to not live alone so its not so isolating.<p>I love being able to focus at home in a way that I never could in previous work environments so I don't want to give it up.  My suggestion is to move into a larger place if you can afford it.  I'd go crazy being stuck in the same 1200ft all the time.  Right before I started telecommuting I moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to a 4 bedroom house (and then some.)  This gives me a dedicated work area that I can get away from in the off time.  The other thing I do is get out of the house for lunch almost every day, usually with friends.<p>I think its normal to feel this way, but you're obviously aware of it and you can find a way to cope.",

Microsoft can mandate that all Powershell commands run under the CLR (and therefore can talk to arbitrary implementations of some CLR class) but any FOSS equivalent is going to have to deal with people wanting to interface programs written for a dozen different runtimes (and probably even some C code running on the bare metal)."

Their approach boils down to \"do whatever makes it the hardest for the police to do their work.\" Which goes wholly against what the founders intended when they wrote that limitations on the power of police to search must be \"reasonable.\"",

      "My reference was what I was informed was the law by multiple lawyers when I lived in New York.  It is possible that I misunderstood or the rules have changed in the last decade, but I am pretty sure neither is the case.  Still you should confirm this with a qualified attorney before accepting what I say as being absolutely true.<p>More precisely I was told that New York recognizes 3 types of employee relationships.  They are hourly, contractor, and professional employee.  The first two are obvious.  You are aware if you have to punch in on a clock, or are a contractor.  The default for software development is therefore the third.<p>As a professional employee there are no set place or hours for your employment.  (That is why you don't get overtime.)  Therefore anything that you do that could possibly relate to your employment is by default assumed to be a work for hire that took place during the course of your employment.  There are admittedly some complications there.  If a programmer writes a novel, that's going to not be a work for hire.  If a programmer writes a program, that's likely going to be a work for hire.  But there are gray areas.  For instance a VB programmer by day who works a C device driver for Linux by night <i>might</i> have a case that their side project doesn't relate to their employment.<p>But just in case, virtually every New York company makes sure that employees sign contracts that clarifies any possible ambiguity..in favor of the employer.  So the reality is that if you live in New York, you can't assume that you own your side project.<p>Incidentally this is the reason that the FSF (which is very careful on intellectual property) requires that they get copyright assignment both from contributers and from the contributers' employers.  Because they don't want to get into a situation where they think they have copyright, but someone else has a legal claim to copyright that code.",

      "It's funny, the activist seems to think the deletion is about appeasing political masters, but in doing this, they actually lend credibility to the opposite point: Just leaving the pages in places is unlikely to cost the BBC a lot.

Reminds me of how Agile failures tended to be explained as &quot;not truly Agile&quot;... but that&#x27;s another story.<p>I judge a system by the implementations, not by the theory. If REST is this beautiful unattainable ideal that almost no one can truly implement, I tend to think the fault doesn&#x27;t lie with the implementers.<p>It&#x27;s quite likely REST simply has very few applications itself, but the applications have the potential to become all-encompassing (like the web itself). But in this case the issue remains REST is not suitable for 99% of the services people expose on-line, as each of those services has a specific scope and application, where REST&#x27;s &quot;network effects&quot; of uniform resource interface and so on don&#x27;t apply.",

It was one of those innocent and functionally useless UI features, that is surprisingly satisfying to preform.",
      "I wouldn't call these tools \"Scary\" unless you're a criminal. These tools have been used to build networks of previously unknown terrorists, put murderers in jail (two of which I had the pleasure of testifying for in high profile cases pro-bono), and frequently (on a daily basis) finds smoking guns in child rape and molestation, grand theft, kidnapping, and a number of other cases to which you should be thankful that you are entirely oblivious to. If you knew what really went on in our society, you'd be helping the good guys out too. I imagine you probably have in your mind some redneck cop pulling you over and checking for text messages on your phone illegally, or some other stupid misappropriation of authority... 99.99% of the time, these tools are used for the right purposes, and against people who might be living on your street, committing unspeakable offenses in private.<p>Now, as for the tools, saurik is entirely correct. The PIN code is, for the most part, just a GUI lock - think of it as a screen saver lock. The file system is encrypted on the chip, but applications need to be able to read and write from the file system. If you read the FAQ, I make no secret about how this works: we boot a custom RAM disk (from DFU mode) that mounts the disk. The kernel takes care of the decryption and because we're not actually booting the OS on disk, we don't have any pesky screen saver lock or anything else to even content with, though if we did, the forensic imaging process runs entirely in the background, and has the same level of access (root) that most of Apple's processes do.<p>As for encryption, what IS encrypted on disk that you can't get from the file system includes keychain passwords, HFS journal (to undelete files, thanks to Jean-Baptiste's most awesome code), and files protected with iOS' data-protection classes. These files are few and far between. In fact, a vast majority of the evidence you'll find on an iPhone is entirely unencrypted. For the files that ARE encrypted, Jean-Baptiste's brute forcing and decryption tools allow us to extract the master encryption keys from the device. Each keychain password is encrypted with its own key (\"AES wrap\"); we apply the device's keys to this wrap, decrypt the password's key, then use that key to decrypt the password. Apple's data-protection classes are about the same. Each file is wrapped and we use one of the class keys to ultimately decrypt the file. This includes the few files on the device that are encrypted, such as email + attachments, and some third party data files using this encryption.<p>Once you unwrap that, you'll find that even applications using their own encryption code are storing keys in the keychain - so once the keychain is decrypted, the keys to these third party crypto stores are equally exposed.<p>The moral of the story here is that the only GOOD way to protect files is 1. To encrypt them (something Apple really doesn't do very well), 2. To have the encryption depend on a very complex key that only the owner has knowledge of and must supply in order to decrypt the files, and finally 3. To protect the device in such a way that the key cannot be intercepted by trojans or other malware. Unfortunately, iOS fails on all of these counts, making it very easy (thanks to many world class hackers contributing code) to defeat all of the encryption on the device, and MOST of the encryption even when the device is password locked.<p>Scary? What's scary here is just how neglected security is on mobile devices, and how easy it would be for me, or Saurik, or anybody who can use code.google.com to steal all of the data on your device in just a few minutes.",

      "I just watched it. I heard pretty much the same aspirations since the 1980s. See <a href=\"https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_82_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_82_2.html</a> for when AutoDesk looked at entering this field.<p>At 15:56 the speaker says &quot;Synthetic chemists normally they design things with plastic model sets.&quot;<p>This just isn&#x27;t true, and hasn&#x27;t been for a very long time. At 17:54 he even says there&#x27;s GUI-based software now to design molecules. That&#x27;s what most chemists use.<p>My experience is that it doesn&#x27;t take 20 minutes to draw a molecule using the current generation of tools. In fact, you can try it now - go to <a href=\"http://web.chemdoodle.com/demos/sketcher\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://web.chemdoodle.com/demos/sketcher</a> or <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit2/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/edit2/index.html</a> or <a href=\"http://scitouch.net/ketcher-demo/ketcher.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://scitouch.net/ketcher-demo/ketcher.html</a> and draw one yourself. (This is for small molecule chemistry. For large molecule chemistry, there are other tools and other issues to worry about.)<p>In minute 23 he talks about computing the second derivative of the force fields, and how complex it is. Thing is, my co-worker did that manually when he wrote the original NAMD implementation. (NAMD is a molecular dynamic program.) So it&#x27;s not something that&#x27;s all that hard to compute. It&#x27;s just tedious. (And his code is 10% slower than the hand-written code, so he knows that people do this sort of thing manually.)<p>While it&#x27;s useful to have automatic code generators if you want to add new force fields often, we just don&#x27;t do it all that often, because parameterizing the force field is the hard problem, not computing the second derivative.<p>At 31:25 he says that SciPy is only really possible because of Boost.Python. This isn&#x27;t true. I just downloaded scipy-0.16.0b2 and verified that it does not use Boost.Python. (&quot;ag -i BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE&quot; finds no matches.)<p>At 49:30 he talks about a technique that sounds like pharmacophore models, which have been around since at least the 1990s. There are tools that will build molecules to fit pharmacophore models.<p>What I didn&#x27;t see was anything about dealing with waters, and counter-ions, toxicity, or AMDE (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) issues.<p>I didn&#x27;t hear anything which required multiple years of tool building (&quot;yak shaving&quot;) to get to what he wanted. Every technique he mentioned is something that people have been doing already, in C/C++/Python.",

      "&quot;not completely isolated from hearing classical music&quot;<p>Many of the most important jazz composers and musicians were classically trained and were intimate with the type of music theory we&#x27;re talking about here. Thelonius Monk could reel off Chopin and Rachmaninoff etudes from memory. &quot;Take the A Train&quot; and many other tunes we associate with Ellington were written by Billy Strayhorn, who&#x27;s main interest was classical music, but found that the classical music establishment at the time would not accept a black composer or musician. Jazz was the only genre in which he was allowed to work. (Ellington/Strayhorn and Monk are considered the most important composers in Jazz, and their initial training was in European classical music.)<p>Jazz <i>is</i> a development of Western classical music, and knows it. In fact, it&#x27;s a rather miraculous revival of the improvisatory tradition that was central to European art music until it died out with the rise of symphonic music in the 19th century. If you listen to some contemporary jazz pianists, for example, Marcus Roberts, there&#x27;s no mistaking the strong influence of European classical music.",

The most popular bands can literally fill a stadium - something common practice music has never done.<p>While that doesn&#x27;t mean pop is better in some absolute sense, it does suggest it&#x27;s doing something right for many listeners.<p>If your training is too rigidly classical it actively stops you being able to hear and understand what that right thing is, because you&#x27;re too busy concentrating on a small subset of the <i>many details</i> in the music."

      "If I may monkeypatch the original argument, I'd point out that there isn't any particular reason that you can't output perfectly accessible HTML with this approach. In some ways its likely to be easier than some other approaches, since when you think this way, you're starting out with more actual, factual semantics in your data representation.<p>Moreover, if you're going to argue the \"nobody's actually going to do it\" argument, I'd say that \"nobody's actually using CSS to generate one HTML page that works in a screen reader, cell phone, rich browser, and REST API\" either. For the same value of \"nobody\", which is to say, not <i>literally</i> nobody, you can find a handful of people, but the idea that there's some mass of developers \"correctly\" using CSS is pretty silly too.",

      "I was inducted into Mu Alpha Theta (a college level math honor society) in 11th grade, the earliest you can be inducted.  We did volunteer work tutoring math once or twice a week.  I've spent a lot of time in online communities for folks with really smart kids -- the parents are typically also smart and it is an environment where many people come to terms with their own social and emotional problems through trying to do right by their kids.  So I've thought a lot about this as well:  Smart people are given a lot of messages to the effect that they have a moral obligation to give away what they know for the benefit of all humankind and if, instead, they use it to make big bucks, then they are evil incarnate.  This mindset can be extremely hard to escape (at least for some people).<p>Universities are rife with such \"idealism\", a form of idealism that I increasingly think is misplaced.  To try to put it in a nutshell:  One requirement for sainthood is that you be persecuted.  We seem to think that good people must suffer horribly as a means to prove their goodness.  I'm increasingly disenchanted with the idea that one has to martyr oneself to be a good person, whether that means dying for the cause or just not getting paid adequately for your work.  I think all that teaches people is that there are only two kinds of people: victims and victimizers and in order to be good you must be a victim because the other choice is intolerable.  I have concluded that trying to be \"good\" by being a willing victim forces others into the role of victimizer even if they don't want to be there.  So I believe that if one wants to genuinely do good in the world, one must pursue a paradigm of symbiotic exchange rather than letting people parasitically use you up and playing the role of martyr/victim.<p>Symbiotic exchange sounds rather like Capitalism.  I don't think that means every thing one does has to be in pursuit of the almighty dollar.  I haven't been here long, but I'm impressed with the quality of HN so far.  I am struck by the fact that it was initially created as a means for people at Y-Combinator to get to know potential applicants -- ie although it's offered as a \"free\" service, it ultimately is part of their business strategy.  It looks to me like this is why HN is a better run forum than many I have participated in which were all-volunteer.  HN can't afford to cater to personal peccadilloes and personality quirks of a volunteer staff.  It has to meet a certain professional standard.  And to the degree that at least some of the members want to apply to Y-Combinator, the participants have motivation as well to remain professional and polite.  It is not a good place to indulge in habits that promote flame-wars and the like because the purpose is not merely social.  Not everyone here will have such a goal, but it still impacts group culture. An influential minority can go a long way towards shaping community behavior.  For some members, there is potentially millions of dollars at stake (if they can get VC from Y-Combinator and launch a highly successful business).  It's strong motivation to behave better than what you see in many online forums where everything is idealistically given away \"free\" and flame-wars and other problems are the rule, not the exception.",

      "(I assume that \"what.\" is a request for an explanation.)<p>A float can store an exact integer of up to 53 bits even on a 32 bit machine.<p>PHP only has signed ints. If you need to store an unsigned int you can either store it internally as signed and only convert it to unsigned with printf() when you output it (and deal with the complexity of comparisons), or use a float and limit yourself to 53 bits.<p>If you have a 64 bit machine then of course you can easily fit an unsigned 32 bit int in that range. But it's wise not to rely on that at least for another few years.<p>In short, if you need more than 32 signed bits of range, and you want to make sure your code will run on any machine, then use a float. If you know you only use 64 bit machines then you have more flexibility. (You can use PHP_INT_SIZE and PHP_INT_MAX to check.)<p>If you need even more range than that then use the built in GMP library.<p>Also, PHP will automatically convert numbers that are too large from ints to float, so normally you don't see any of this. It's only if you use settype() to force an int that you have to pay attention to this.",

      "I started a studio to develop video games. Its definitely not hard to get into at all. You just need the passion to complete a full game then release. The biggest thing to decide is which market you will choose, because some are better than others. I wouldn't choose the console market as the indie games on there struggle to get decent revenue. I love the mobile development choice because when your meeting new people and friends you can whip out your phone and show them on the spot. Its part of the reward of releasing a game.<p>When you release a game immediately start working on either promotion, features to improve the current game, or your next game. Do not do what I did and sit around looking over all of the numbers, that will disappoint you. Start thinking about the next game you can develop and expand upon what you learned from the previous project.<p>Once the feedback and numbers start coming in for the released game start tweaking it and release updates every other week until you are happy with the numbers and players stop requesting changes."

      "First of all, you shouldn't take the prices on wire services websites as the price everyone pays. In my experience, these can be discounted 50-75% if your account rep is hungry believes you can be more than a one-off client.<p>Second, you should take a hard look at how news-worthy your release is to the general public. If you're announcing a rewrite of your webapp into scala, then you should skip a press release and just target the handful of outlets in your niche. This can be a hard one to do since you may have spent the last 10mo tirelessly devoted to feature x and it's all you and everyone at your company talk about. Strive to regain focus and take a critical look at how exciting the mass media is going to find your announcement.<p>I've never just used a wire service and expected results. If you are a small startup and are really announcing something that meets the criteria of the paragraph above you'll probably land a few hits - small blogs, regional print, maybe a trade pub. Wire services should only be a small part of your strategy for announcing a new release.<p>The direct outreach is the most important for real results. Hopefully you've been building a list of media contacts that communicate relevant information about your industry, if not start now. If you haven't already, sign up for HARO (<a href=\"http://helpareporter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://helpareporter.com</a>) and look for reporters who are actually looking to write about things your company does//makes//gives away.<p>On the day you release your update, I would send an email individually to those people on your list. Write them a short, personal message explaining what you've announced and why it's interesting. Add the text of your press release below your email and make sure to include ample ways for them to contact you (cellphone, aim, etc) if they're interested in any followup.<p>As for writing a press release: very few PR people will understand what you're doing as well as you. On the other hand, those people spend all day interfacing with the press you're after, so they have an idea of how to effectively communicate with them. I would suggest the best writer on your team takes a stab at writing the press release. Then pass it around for folks peer-review it (friends, girlfriends, english lit majors, whatever). Don't be afraid to cut down the verbage. Don't over-inflate your accomplishment(s). Don't use geeky terms.<p>One thing I've had great success with is teaming up with a college student who wants to get into PR. It's a great opportunity to cut their teeth on something real, and for you to have someone else obsess about the wording in the release while you manage the 500-or-so pre-release emergencies that tend to crop up.<p>Lastly, you should also take a look at marketwire. I've had experience w/ most of the wires you mention and mw was my fav for tech.",

      "I'd be happy to do better, but I don't see any limits my approach imposes that are problematic.<p>For slavery, I think he first noticed some kind of problem. Maybe he was a slave owner and didn't like disobedient, unproductive, or dishonest slaves. He may have at first thought this was just a problem with how he treated his own slaves that his neighbors had already fixed.<p>So he goes and asks his neighbors about it. He's not trying to rock the boat, just make a bit more money. He finds out his neighbors have the same problem. So that pushes him in the direction of seeing it as a problem with slavery in general. But he still expects there will be a solution that keeps slavery more or less in tact.<p>So then he looks for a solution. He tries different ways of treating his slaves and tries to figure out which result in more cotton production. As he learns about what works, it gradually leads him away from slavery.<p>This example shows how someone could end up becoming anti-slavery by accident, just by trying to solve immediate, practical problems.<p>There were also other ways to become opposed to slavery. For example, one could notice that slavery is an exception to widespread traditions that existed at the time. And one could wonder: what is the reason for making this exception? People did wonder that, and they had answers like that black people are less than human. But one could notice problems with those answers. They aren't very intellectually satisfying arguments and they had logical flaws. Or one might talk to a black man for an hour and notice he seems like a normal human.",

      "Few books from this year:<p>The New Solution Selling -- The first sales book I ever read and extremely enlightening.  It demystified much of the sales process for me.<p>The Intelligent Investor -- Timeless ideas on investing.<p>Steve Jobs -- I had no intention of reading this book but found it incredibly interesting.  Very insightful.<p>The Intelligent Entrepreneur -- This book followed 3 HBS grads from pre-HBS to entrepreneur success, and attempted to draw some overarching conclusions on what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur.  Very interesting.<p>Name of the Wind -- The only fully fiction book I read this year.  Great book.  Waiting on the 3rd to come out before I read the second in the series.<p>Dreaming in Code -- I'd heard great things about this book but I felt it was very lacking in insight.  Some interesting moments but overall a disappointment.  Perhaps it is because I read it after ~6 years of professional programming experience + 4 years of school + a number of other programming books?<p>Teaching Minds -- Roger Schank's latest book on education.  In this one he outlines key cognitive abilities that education should be centered around rather than subjects.  Very interesting.<p>A Concise Guide to Macroeconomics -- I had read very little macroeconomics, and this book provided a very readable and quick guide on the basics.<p>Bounce (by Matthew Syed) -- Great book about how great performers became great performers.  This goes back to the nurture vs nature debate, and sides very heavily on the nurture side.  Syed was an olympic ping pong player from the UK.<p>The Willpower Instinct -- I'm still reading this one (with my wife), and find it to be unbelievably insightful.  If you have any desires to change any habits or behaviors, this book is incredible.<p>The Innovator's Solution -- The book after The Innovators Dilemma.  Very insightful, just like the previous one."

That alone is so useful I miss it still (MSVC has had the almost equivalent 'code definition' pane for a while, but it's so slow to update it's still effectively useless).<p>Also, to this day it seems like the only code editor that I've seen which doesn't use monospaced fonts, and better yet, utilizes that properly (for example, parentheses vary slightly in size according to nesting level, so it's easy to see at a glance which parentheses match).",

      "> The original arguments for OO were: it's better for managing complexity, and it creates programs that are easier to change. Both of these turned out not to be true in general.<p>Wrong. Even the worst Enterprisey mess of Java classes and interfaces that you can find today, is probably better than most of the spaghetti, global state ridden, wild west that existed in the golden days of \"procedural\" programming.<p>If you consider that software is composed of Code and Data, then OOP was the first programming model that offered a solid, practical and efficient approach to the organization of data, code and the relationship between the two. That resulted in programs that, given their size and amount of features, were generally easier to understand and change.<p>That doesn't mean OOP was perfect, or that it couldn't be misused; it was never a silver bullet. With the last generation of software developers trained from the ground up with at least some idea that code and data and need to be organized and structured properly, it's time to leave many of the practices and patterns of \"pure\" OOP and evolve into something better. In particular, Functional has finally become practical in the mainstream, with most languages offering efficient methods for developing with functional patterns.",

      "> I can read the kernel portion of the POSIX specs without crying.<p>POSIX is an incredibly poor guide to what a modern OS does.  Even in the parts related to storage, they&#x27;re hopelessly outdated - either forcing onerous compatibility with systems that haven&#x27;t been sold in twenty years, or completely failing to address issues that have gained in importance over that same time.  The network parts are even worse.  There isn&#x27;t even a POSIX spec for virtualization, and internal issues such as NUMA or PCI/USB enumeration were never under their purview to begin with.<p>If the requirements for a modern kernel were specified to the same degree as those for a modern browser, they&#x27;d be much <i>longer</i>.  Note that external protocols and formats are not part of the browser&#x27;s own specification unless you apply the same rule for external protocols and formats used by the kernel - pulling in a ton of stuff from IETF, PCI SIG, IBTA,   SATA-IO, ANSI T10, etc.  It&#x27;s only fair, but again you&#x27;d end up with something far longer than the browser equivalent.<p>The responsibilities of an OS kernel are far deeper and broader than almost anyone out in browser-land thinks.  I&#x27;m quite sure that works the other way too.  Just because it&#x27;s harder to see detail from further away doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not there.",
      "This is assuming a very naive snapshot of a mutated memory block.  I would assume that if you were doing something that needed snapshots of each instant of the program, you would come up with a much more sane algorithm for getting that done.<p>It would probably use many of the same tricks as the immutable structures.  Which is why I would assume they would be equal.  (That is, I realize that immutable structures don&#x27;t do a full copy on every &quot;change.&quot;  Depending on the structure and the change, they don&#x27;t even do a copy at all.)<p>Consider, we basically just described how git works, no?",
      "I&#x27;m in Detroit right now, Midtown is not really a suburb at all, it is 1.4 miles from downtown according to Google Maps. Midtown, which houses Wayne State, has all the amenities a urban state college would have, including a grocery store. There is also a fantastic supermarket in Mexicantown.<p>Detroit is a very interesting place. There are bombed out sections I would hate to go to, but there are also great areas such as Eastern Market, Midtown, the Riverwalk etc. Some areas are extremely hospitable to biking on the road, but the custom is to ride on the sidewalk. Other areas have very nice bike trails. It&#x27;s one of the most interesting cities I&#x27;ve been to. The dichotomy of buildings being destroyed next to areas in which young people are attempting to revive the city is impressive to watch.",
      "I guess I&#x27;m confused.  Where (besides downtown) do you actually mean then?  Downtown has plenty like the Supermercado, Honeybee, etc.  As you start to go out, hit Grosse Pointe, Hamtramck, etc. there&#x27;s quite a few as well (and the prices were pretty reasonable).  So...can you be more specific about where there aren&#x27;t grocery stores so there can be a reasonable discussion with concrete data?",
      "As someone who comes from a family of small farmers, this is not really true.  Organic pesticides are on-average more harmful to the people who use them than modern pesticides.  Simply put, organic pesticides attack animal/fungal life indiscriminately.  Including human life.  Most organic pesticides will kill you at fairly low quantities.  Most man-made ones won&#x27;t, they are tailored to a task.  And organic farmers need to use a lot more pesticides than non-organic farmers to achieve the same results, making human toxicity even more likely.",
      "Yeah, this is a fair criticism. There are explicit bounds encoded in each problem and when those conflict with your estimates, you will be frustrated.<p>Haven&#x27;t got a frigging clue isn&#x27;t a fair thing to say though.  The whole point of the exercise is that most people have a significant misalignment going on between their modelling of reality and the track record of their modelling ability.<p>Exercises like figuring out how much milk a cow produces in a week or how fast a horse runs require you to consider what information you DO have suggests about upper and lower bounds and things like that, and then correctly realizing the confidence of your models is the other half of the equation.<p>You are pretty sure, I would imagine, that a cow doesn&#x27;t produce 10,000 gallons of milk in a week. You are pretty sure that a &#x27;heavy&#x27; user of a vending machine might use three a day and buy a bunch of snacks and a drink or two, and that &#x27;heavy&#x27; users maximally represent Y% of the population, with high confidence.<p>You can use these intuitions to guide your estimates, and you do in fact do so on a regular basis.  The exercise is calibrating those estimates against their empirical accuracy."

      "I have Aspergers, and I can attest to this... I spend most of my time on my PC connecting to the world. I work from home as a programmer and I have maybe 4-5 friends that I see often (once every few weeks, I go for a walk to the store with one every day) but I spend the majority of time in my space, designing, building and deploying things online and reading to try to gain more knowledge of the world. Now, the question is, how would a personal space on Mars be any different from a personal space here?

At any rate, although the visual paradigm they are using looks very much like a Venn diagram, I'm not sure overlapping circles, especially when they aren't being used to delineate overlapping and exclusive groups of a population, necessarily only have that one interpretation.  It seems more like a bad visual choice for a series of A+B=C sorts of statements.  \\nAnyway, take your politics elsewhere.",

      "Now that you point it out I also consider a \"coffee shop\" to be like a starbucks or something and might not be as affected by this.<p>Eateries like Panera Bread and Cosi (who offer free wifi) should be more worried about non-paying users taking up seats during afternoon lunch hours. Also, good point about someone reading the paper. The problem is nonpaying customers spending hours on end, taking up seats that paying customers could use, regardless of what they are doing.<p>Maybe they could charge you like a coffee an hour or something.",

      "No, TechCrunch somehow misunderstood what was going on. It's the same company, and the same project.",

      "Certainly over the course of Apple's decades they've made many managing mistakes and it would be trivial for an insider to make a list of any five of them, without ordering of \"the top five\" or anything like this.<p>It's impossible to be around for so long and to employ many people and not make any mistakes. No company is perfect. Coming away from this presentation thinking \"pffft Company X is so much better because they don't do this\" is a huge mistake - if you aren't making mistakes, you aren't trying.",
      "Windows performance can suck on hardware well above the \"minimum system requirements\", and this has taught most computer users to know that new features come at a price.<p>Mac OS X's trend of new releases being faster on the same hardware is a shockingly rare exception to the norm, and due to Apple's habit of releasing features before they're optimized. (The whole Quartz system took several releases to get up to acceptable performance, and Spotlight also made very significant gains after the initial release.)",
      "There is very little paperwork required to get a resident permit and register a limited company in UK. In the last 6 years the administration has taken measures to prevent abuse of unemployment benefits and child support by self-employed ppl (mainly immigrants from Poland). But as far as one can sustain himself and pays taxes he is trouble free.<p>My impression is that most of the Asian, African, Balkan, etc newcomers to London are self-employed or LTD owners. That route is far easier than getting a work permit.",
      "I know several Apple and ex-Apple engineers. Let's just say that the environment isn't even comparable. Google wins hands down. One of my friends at Apple had to file for an information request so that she could debug a problem that spanned multiple layers of abstraction. A Google engineer faced with that kind of inanity would just quit.",
      "I tried Zendesk a while ago. To me, Zendesk seemed to be overkill and I found it hard to work with.",
      "It's even worse than lowered productivity for me.  I just start getting straight-up depressed; just absolutely terrible feeling.  No energy, no drive, no light.  And then I realize that somewhere in the last two weeks I stopped my regular exercise regiment for some reason or another and pick it back up - cured instantly.<p>It's easy to fool yourself into thinking that the funk caused the stop in exercise but that's nearly never the case.<p>EVERYBODY, hacker or not, should be getting regular exercise.  Please.  You won't regret it.",
